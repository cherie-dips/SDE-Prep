          learn: '<div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Why This Matters</div><p class="learn-p">Imagine you open 50 browser tabs, a music player, and a code editor simultaneously on your laptop. The operating system must track each application\'s execution state, swap between them thousands of times per second, and ensure that pausing one application to run another does not corrupt either\'s data. Process states, the PCB, and context switching are the mechanisms that make this illusion of simultaneous execution possible.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">What is a Process?</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>process</b> is a program in execution. While a program is a passive entity stored on disk (an executable file), a process is an <b>active entity</b> with a program counter, a set of associated resources, and a current state. Each process has its own address space comprising the <b>text segment</b> (code), <b>data segment</b> (global variables), <b>heap</b> (dynamically allocated memory), and <b>stack</b> (temporary data such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables).</p><p class="learn-p">When you launch an application, the OS creates a process by loading the executable into memory, allocating resources, and initializing a <b>Process Control Block (PCB)</b>.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Process States</div><p class="learn-p">During its lifetime, a process transitions through several states. The <b>five-state model</b> is the most commonly used:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>New</b> &mdash; The process is being created. The OS allocates a PCB and resources.</li><li><b>Ready</b> &mdash; The process is loaded in main memory and is waiting to be assigned to a CPU. It is in the <b>ready queue</b>.</li><li><b>Running</b> &mdash; The process\'s instructions are currently being executed by the CPU. On a single-core system, only one process can be in this state at a time.</li><li><b>Waiting (Blocked)</b> &mdash; The process is waiting for some event to occur (e.g., I/O completion, signal reception). It cannot proceed until the event happens.</li><li><b>Terminated</b> &mdash; The process has finished execution. The OS deallocates its resources and removes the PCB.</li></ol><p class="learn-p">Key transitions:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>New &rarr; Ready:</b> Admitted by the long-term scheduler.</li><li><b>Ready &rarr; Running:</b> Dispatched by the short-term (CPU) scheduler.</li><li><b>Running &rarr; Ready:</b> Interrupted (e.g., time quantum expires in preemptive scheduling).</li><li><b>Running &rarr; Waiting:</b> Process issues an I/O request or waits for an event.</li><li><b>Waiting &rarr; Ready:</b> The event the process was waiting for completes.</li><li><b>Running &rarr; Terminated:</b> Process finishes execution or is killed.</li></ul><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> In interview questions, remember that a process in the <b>Waiting</b> state cannot directly move to <b>Running</b>. It must first transition to <b>Ready</b> and then be scheduled.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Process Control Block (PCB)</div><p class="learn-p">The <b>PCB</b> (also called Task Control Block) is a data structure maintained by the OS for every process. It is the repository of all information needed to manage the process. The PCB contains:</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Process ID (PID)</td><td>Unique identifier for the process</td></tr><tr><td>Process State</td><td>Current state (New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated)</td></tr><tr><td>Program Counter (PC)</td><td>Address of the next instruction to execute</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Registers</td><td>Contents of all process-centric registers (accumulator, stack pointer, general-purpose registers)</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Scheduling Info</td><td>Priority, pointers to scheduling queues</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Management Info</td><td>Page tables, segment tables, base/limit registers</td></tr><tr><td>Accounting Info</td><td>CPU time used, time limits, process numbers</td></tr><tr><td>I/O Status Info</td><td>List of I/O devices allocated, list of open files</td></tr></table><div class="learn-code">// Simplified PCB structure in C\nstruct PCB {\n    int pid;\n    int state;           // NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED\n    int program_counter;\n    int registers[16];   // General-purpose registers\n    int priority;\n    struct PageTable *page_table;\n    struct FileDesc *open_files;\n    struct PCB *next;    // Pointer for queue linkage\n};</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Context Switch</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>context switch</b> occurs when the CPU switches from executing one process to another. This is the mechanism that enables multitasking. The steps involved are:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li>An interrupt or system call triggers the switch.</li><li>The OS <b>saves the context</b> (CPU registers, program counter, etc.) of the currently running process into its PCB.</li><li>The OS updates the state of the current process (Running &rarr; Ready or Running &rarr; Waiting).</li><li>The OS <b>selects a new process</b> from the ready queue using the CPU scheduling algorithm.</li><li>The OS <b>loads the context</b> of the selected process from its PCB into the CPU registers.</li><li>The OS updates the state of the new process (Ready &rarr; Running) and transfers control to it.</li></ol><p class="learn-p"><b>Context switch time</b> is pure overhead &mdash; the system does no useful work during the switch. Typical context switch times range from 1&ndash;10 microseconds on modern hardware. The time depends on:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>Memory speed and number of registers to save/restore</li><li>Hardware support (some CPUs have special instructions for fast context switching)</li><li>Whether the OS needs to flush the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)</li></ul><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> Context switching between processes is more expensive than between threads of the same process, because threads share the same address space (no TLB flush needed).</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Overhead factors:</b> Direct cost includes saving/restoring registers. Indirect costs include TLB and cache pollution &mdash; after a context switch, the new process may experience many cache misses because the cache now contains data from the previous process.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">System Calls &amp; Mode Switch</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>system call</b> is the interface between a user process and the OS kernel. When a process needs OS services (file I/O, process creation, memory allocation), it triggers a <b>mode switch</b> from <b>user mode</b> to <b>kernel mode</b> via a software interrupt (trap).</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>User Mode</th><th>Kernel Mode</th></tr><tr><td>Privilege</td><td>Restricted &mdash; cannot access hardware or kernel memory</td><td>Full access to hardware, memory, and all instructions</td></tr><tr><td>Failure impact</td><td>Only the process crashes</td><td>Can crash the entire system</td></tr><tr><td>Code running</td><td>Application code</td><td>OS kernel code</td></tr></table><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> A <b>mode switch</b> (user &harr; kernel) is NOT the same as a <b>context switch</b>. A mode switch happens within the same process (e.g., system call), costs ~1&ndash;2 &mu;s, and does not save/restore the full PCB. A context switch changes which process is running and costs 1&ndash;10 &mu;s.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Schedulers &amp; Dispatcher</div><p class="learn-p">The OS uses three types of schedulers:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Long-term Scheduler (Job Scheduler):</b> Controls the degree of multiprogramming by deciding which processes are admitted from the job pool to the ready queue. It runs infrequently.</li><li><b>Short-term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler):</b> Selects from among the ready processes and allocates the CPU. It runs very frequently (every few milliseconds).</li><li><b>Medium-term Scheduler:</b> Handles <b>swapping</b> &mdash; temporarily removes processes from main memory to reduce the degree of multiprogramming, then reintroduces them later.</li></ul><p class="learn-p">The <b>Dispatcher</b> is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It performs the actual context switch, switches to user mode, and jumps to the correct location in the program. The time the dispatcher takes is called <b>dispatch latency</b>.</p><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> The scheduler <b>decides</b> which process runs next; the dispatcher <b>performs</b> the switch. DE Shaw interviews often ask about this distinction, along with context switch overhead for processes vs. threads and TLB flushing.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Patterns &amp; Variations</div><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Variation</th><th>Description</th><th>Where Used</th></tr><tr><td>5-State Model</td><td>New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated</td><td>Standard OS textbook model</td></tr><tr><td>7-State Model</td><td>Adds Suspended-Ready and Suspended-Waiting for swapped-out processes</td><td>Systems with limited RAM &amp; swapping</td></tr><tr><td>Zombie State</td><td>Process terminated but PCB entry remains until parent reads exit status</td><td>Unix/Linux</td></tr><tr><td>Voluntary vs Involuntary Switch</td><td>Process yields CPU (yield/sleep) vs preempted by timer interrupt</td><td>Cooperative vs preemptive OS</td></tr></table><p class="learn-p">Modern Linux uses a <b>task_struct</b> (over 600 fields) instead of a simple PCB. It includes scheduling class, memory descriptor, filesystem info, signal handlers, and cgroup/namespace references for containers.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Pitfalls &amp; Edge Cases</div><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Waiting to Running is INVALID:</b> A blocked process must always transition to Ready first, then be scheduled to Running.</li><li><b>Context switch cost is not constant:</b> It varies by hardware, TLB flush requirements, and cache pollution effects.</li><li><b>Confusing process state with scheduling queue:</b> A process in Waiting is on an I/O wait queue, NOT the ready queue.</li><li><b>PCB size matters:</b> Linux\'s task_struct is 6-8 KB, significant when switching thousands of times per second.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Complexity &amp; Comparison</div><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Operation</th><th>Time Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Context switch (process)</td><td>1-10 &mu;s direct + cache effects</td><td>Requires TLB flush, register save/restore</td></tr><tr><td>Context switch (thread, same process)</td><td>0.5-5 &mu;s</td><td>No TLB flush, shared address space</td></tr><tr><td>Process creation (fork)</td><td>~100 &mu;s</td><td>Uses Copy-on-Write for efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>Thread creation</td><td>~10 &mu;s</td><td>~10x faster than process creation</td></tr><tr><td>PCB lookup</td><td><span class="learn-complexity">O(1)</span></td><td>Indexed by PID in a hash table or array</td></tr></table></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: What is the difference between a program and a process?</b><br>A: A program is a passive entity (an executable file on disk). A process is an active entity with a program counter, stack, heap, and allocated resources. Multiple processes can run the same program simultaneously.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why can\'t a process in the Waiting state go directly to Running?</b><br>A: The Waiting state means the process is blocked on an event. When the event completes, the process moves to Ready, where the CPU scheduler decides when to dispatch it. Skipping Ready would bypass the scheduler.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the difference between process and thread context switches?</b><br>A: Process switches require saving/restoring the full PCB including page table base register, triggering a TLB flush. Thread switches within the same process share the address space, so no TLB flush is needed, making them 2-5x faster.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What are the indirect costs of a context switch?</b><br>A: Cache pollution is the biggest indirect cost. After a switch, the new process finds its data is not in the L1/L2/L3 caches, leading to many cold cache misses. The TLB also needs to be repopulated.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does the OS decide when to perform a context switch?</b><br>A: Switches are triggered by: (1) timer interrupts (preemptive scheduling), (2) I/O requests or system calls, (3) higher-priority process becoming ready, or (4) process termination.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is the role of the medium-term scheduler?</b><br>A: The medium-term scheduler manages swapping: it suspends processes by moving them from RAM to disk when memory is scarce, controlling the degree of multiprogramming and preventing thrashing.</p></div>',

When you pipe commands together (e.g., <code>grep pattern file | sort | uniq -c</code>), the shell sets up pipes between child processes for IPC. Understanding process creation and IPC is fundamental to systems programming.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Process Creation</div><p class="learn-p">In Unix/Linux, a new process is created using the <code>fork()</code> system call.

Both parent and child share the same physical pages (marked read-only). Only when either process writes to a page does the OS create a separate copy. This makes fork() very efficient.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">exec() Family of System Calls</div><p class="learn-p">After <code>fork()</code>, the child often calls one of the <code>exec()</code> family functions to replace its address space with a new program.

An orphan is a running child whose parent has terminated; it is adopted by init (PID 1), which will eventually reap it.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Why is shared memory the fastest IPC mechanism?</b><br>A: After initial setup (mmap/shm_open), data transfer happens through direct memory reads and writes with no kernel involvement. Pipes and message queues require system calls for each send/receive.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: When would you choose message passing over shared memory?</b><br>A: Message passing is preferred when: (1) processes are on different machines, (2) you want built-in synchronization, (3) the communication pattern is well-structured, or (4) you want to avoid manual synchronization complexity.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What happens if you call exec() without fork() first?</b><br>A: The current process\'s address space is replaced by the new program. The original program ceases to exist. Usually fork() is called first so the original process continues running.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How many processes are created by fork(); fork(); fork(); and why?</b><br>A: 8 total processes (2^3). Each fork() doubles the count: 1&rarr;2&rarr;4&rarr;8. Every process (parent and children) executes the subsequent fork() calls, so the number doubles at each step. Draw a binary tree to trace: each fork creates one new branch.</p></div>',

Typically alpha = 0.5. Older observations have exponentially decreasing influence.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How would you prevent starvation in SJF?</b><br>A: Use <b>aging</b>: periodically decrease the effective burst time estimate of waiting processes.

Creating a separate process per connection would be prohibitively expensive. Threads provide concurrency within a single address space at ~10x lower creation cost and ~5x faster context switching. Understanding threads and threading models is critical for designing concurrent systems.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">What is a Thread?</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>thread</b> is the smallest unit of CPU execution. It is a lightweight process that shares the same address space as other threads within the same process. Each thread has its own:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Thread ID</b></li><li><b>Program Counter (PC)</b></li><li><b>Register set</b></li><li><b>Stack</b></li></ul><p class="learn-p">Threads within the same process <b>share</b>:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>Code section (text segment)</li><li>Data section (global variables)</li><li>Open files and signals</li><li>Heap memory</li></ul><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> The key interview distinction: processes have separate address spaces; threads share the same address space. This makes thread creation, context switching, and communication much cheaper than for processes.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Benefits of Multithreading</div><p class="learn-p">There are four major categories of benefits:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>Responsiveness:</b> A multithreaded application can continue to respond to user input even when one thread is performing a lengthy operation (e.g., a web browser rendering one page while fetching another).</li><li><b>Resource Sharing:</b> Threads share the address space and resources of their process, which is more efficient than inter-process communication.</li><li><b>Economy:</b> Thread creation is ~30x faster than process creation. Context switching between threads is ~5x faster because there\'s no need to switch address spaces or flush the TLB.</li><li><b>Scalability:</b> Threads can run in parallel on multicore systems, achieving true parallelism.</li></ol></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">User-Level Threads vs. Kernel-Level Threads</div><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Feature</th><th>User-Level Threads (ULT)</th><th>Kernel-Level Threads (KLT)</th></tr><tr><td>Managed by</td><td>User-space thread library</td><td>Operating system kernel</td></tr><tr><td>Kernel awareness</td><td>Kernel is unaware of threads</td><td>Kernel manages each thread</td></tr><tr><td>Context switch</td><td>Very fast (no kernel involvement)</td><td>Slower (requires kernel mode switch)</td></tr><tr><td>Blocking</td><td>If one thread blocks, ALL threads in the process block</td><td>Only the blocking thread is affected</td></tr><tr><td>Multicore utilization</td><td>Cannot use multiple cores (kernel sees one thread)</td><td>Can run on different cores in parallel</td></tr><tr><td>Examples</td><td>GNU Portable Threads, Green Threads</td><td>Windows threads, Linux pthreads (NPTL)</td></tr></table><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> The biggest disadvantage of pure user-level threads is that a blocking system call blocks the entire process, since the kernel only sees one thread of execution.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Multithreading Models</div><p class="learn-p">The relationship between user-level threads and kernel-level threads is established through one of three models:</p><div class="learn-h">1. Many-to-One Model</div><p class="learn-p">Many user-level threads are mapped to a <b>single kernel thread</b>. Thread management is done in user space, making it efficient. However:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>If one thread makes a blocking call, the entire process blocks.</li><li>Cannot exploit multicore parallelism.</li><li>Example: Solaris Green Threads, GNU Portable Threads.</li></ul><div class="learn-h">2. One-to-One Model</div><p class="learn-p">Each user-level thread maps to a <b>separate kernel thread</b>. This provides more concurrency than many-to-one:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>One thread blocking does not block others.</li><li>Multiple threads can run in parallel on multicore systems.</li><li>Overhead: creating a user thread requires creating a corresponding kernel thread, which can be expensive.</li><li>Example: <b>Linux (NPTL)</b>, Windows threads.</li></ul><div class="learn-h">3. Many-to-Many Model</div><p class="learn-p">Many user-level threads are multiplexed over a <b>smaller or equal number</b> of kernel threads. This provides the best of both worlds:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>True concurrency (threads can run on different cores).</li><li>No blocking of entire process.</li><li>User can create as many threads as needed without overwhelming the kernel.</li><li>More complex to implement.</li><li>Example: Solaris prior to version 9, Windows ThreadFiber package.</li></ul><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Modern systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) predominantly use the <b>one-to-one model</b> because kernel thread creation has become efficient enough, and the simplicity of the model outweighs the overhead.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">POSIX Threads (pthreads)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>pthreads</b> is the standard API for creating and managing threads in Unix/Linux. Key functions:</p><div class="learn-code">pthread_create(&amp;tid, &amp;attr, function, arg); // Create thread\npthread_join(tid, &amp;retval);                  // Wait for thread\npthread_exit(retval);                        // Thread exits\npthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);                  // Lock mutex\npthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);                // Unlock mutex</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Thread Pools</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>thread pool</b> creates a number of threads at startup and keeps them waiting for work. When a request arrives, a thread from the pool handles it, then returns to the pool. Benefits:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>Faster to service a request with an existing thread than to create a new one.</li><li>Limits the total number of threads, preventing system resource exhaustion.</li><li>Separates the mechanism of creating the task from its execution.</li></ul><p class="learn-p">Thread pools are used extensively in web servers (e.g., Apache, Tomcat), database connection pooling, and the Java <code>ExecutorService</code>.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Thread Cancellation</div><p class="learn-p">Sometimes a thread must be terminated before it completes (e.g., user cancels a search). Two approaches:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Asynchronous cancellation:</b> The target thread is terminated <b>immediately</b>. Dangerous because the thread may be in the middle of updating shared data or holding a lock.</li><li><b>Deferred cancellation (default in pthreads):</b> The target thread periodically checks whether it should terminate at designated <b>cancellation points</b>. This allows the thread to clean up resources, release locks, and exit gracefully.</li></ul><div class="learn-code">pthread_cancel(tid);                          // Request cancellation\npthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, NULL); // Deferred (default)\npthread_testcancel();                         // Cancellation point check\npthread_cleanup_push(cleanup_handler, arg);   // Register cleanup handler\npthread_cleanup_pop(execute);                 // Remove handler</div><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> Asynchronous cancellation can leave mutexes locked and memory leaked. Always prefer deferred cancellation with proper cleanup handlers.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Thread-Local Storage (TLS)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Thread-Local Storage</b> provides each thread with its own copy of a variable, even though they share the same address space. Unlike stack variables (which are local to a function), TLS variables persist across function calls within the same thread.</p><div class="learn-code">// C11 / C++11\nthread_local int perThreadCounter = 0;\n\n// POSIX\n__thread int perThreadCounter = 0;\n\n// Java\nThreadLocal&lt;Integer&gt; counter = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);</div><p class="learn-p">Common uses: errno (each thread needs its own error code), per-thread caches, transaction IDs, and random number generator state.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">fork() in Multithreaded Programs</div><p class="learn-p">Calling <code>fork()</code> in a multithreaded program is <b>extremely dangerous</b>. POSIX specifies that only the <b>calling thread</b> is duplicated in the child process &mdash; all other threads vanish. This leads to critical problems:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>If another thread held a mutex at the time of fork, that mutex is <b>permanently locked</b> in the child (the thread that would unlock it doesn\'t exist).</li><li>Heap state may be inconsistent if another thread was mid-allocation.</li><li>The child should call <code>exec()</code> immediately or use only async-signal-safe functions.</li></ul><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Use <code>pthread_atfork()</code> to register handlers that acquire/release all locks around fork, ensuring the child starts with a consistent state. Better yet: fork before creating threads, or use <code>posix_spawn()</code>.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Hardware Threads &amp; Hyper-Threading (SMT)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)</b>, marketed as Intel Hyper-Threading, allows a single physical CPU core to present <b>two (or more) logical cores</b> to the OS. Each logical core has its own architectural state (registers, PC) but shares execution units, caches, and TLB with its sibling.</p><ul class="learn-list"><li>A 4-core CPU with 2-way SMT appears as <b>8 logical CPUs</b> to the OS.</li><li>Benefit: when one hardware thread stalls on a cache miss, the other can use the execution units (~15-30% throughput gain for mixed workloads).</li><li>Limitation: two compute-heavy threads on the same core compete for ALUs and cache &mdash; performance can degrade.</li><li>Security: Hyper-Threading enables side-channel attacks (e.g., PortSmash, TLBleed) because sibling threads share microarchitectural state.</li></ul><p class="learn-p">For latency-sensitive systems (e.g., DE Shaw trading infrastructure), SMT is sometimes <b>disabled</b> to eliminate jitter and side-channel risk.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Patterns &amp; Variations</div><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Model</th><th>User:Kernel Ratio</th><th>Blocking</th><th>Multicore?</th><th>Example</th></tr><tr><td>Many-to-One</td><td>N:1</td><td>One blocks all</td><td>No</td><td>GNU Portable Threads</td></tr><tr><td>One-to-One</td><td>1:1</td><td>Independent</td><td>Yes</td><td>Linux NPTL, Windows</td></tr><tr><td>Many-to-Many</td><td>M:N</td><td>Independent</td><td>Yes</td><td>Solaris pre-9</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Level</td><td>M:N + 1:1</td><td>Flexible</td><td>Yes</td><td>IRIX, HP-UX</td></tr><tr><td>Green Threads (modern)</td><td>M:N with work-stealing</td><td>User-level scheduler</td><td>Yes</td><td>Go goroutines, Java virtual threads</td></tr></table><p class="learn-p"><b>Go goroutines</b> use a modern M:N model with a work-stealing scheduler.

Parallelism means tasks physically execute simultaneously on different cores.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why do modern systems use the one-to-one threading model?</b><br>A: One-to-one provides true parallelism on multicore hardware and avoids the blocking problem of many-to-one. Kernel thread creation overhead (~10 &mu;s) has decreased enough to make M:N complexity unnecessary for most workloads.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What are the advantages of Go goroutines over pthreads?</b><br>A: Goroutines have ~2 KB initial stack (vs 1-8 MB), creation takes ~1 &mu;s (vs ~10 &mu;s), and the Go runtime multiplexes millions of goroutines onto a small number of OS threads.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is a thread pool?</b><br>A: A thread pool pre-creates worker threads that pull tasks from a queue. Benefits: avoids per-request creation/destruction overhead, limits concurrency. Used in web servers and Java ExecutorService.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Can two threads of the same process have different scheduling priorities?</b><br>A: Yes. In the one-to-one model, each thread has its own kernel thread with an independent priority, allowing high-priority UI threads and low-priority background threads.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why is fork() dangerous in a multithreaded program?</b><br>A: Only the calling thread is copied to the child. If another thread held a mutex, that mutex is permanently locked in the child. Use exec() immediately after fork, or use posix_spawn().</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is thread-local storage and when would you use it?</b><br>A: TLS gives each thread its own copy of a variable (declared with thread_local in C++11). Used for errno, per-thread caches, and RNG state &mdash; avoids synchronization overhead for data that is logically per-thread.</p></div>',

This is <b>undefined behavior</b> in C/C++ &mdash; the compiler may optimize assuming no data races.</li><li><b>Race condition:</b> The program\'s correctness depends on the relative timing of events. A race condition can exist even with proper locking (e.g., check-then-act pattern).</li></ul><div class="learn-code">// Data race (undefined behavior):\nint x = 0;\n// Thread A:  x = 1;\n// Thread B:  cout << x;  // may print 0, 1, or crash\n\n// Race condition (no data race, but still a bug):\nmutex m;\n// Thread A: lock(m); if(!map.count(k)) { unlock(m); lock(m); map[k]=v; unlock(m); }\n// Thread B may insert k between A\'s unlock and re-lock</div><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Eliminating data races (via mutexes, atomics) does not eliminate race conditions.

A race condition is a logical timing bug where correctness depends on execution order. You can have race conditions even with proper locking.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Explain false sharing and how to fix it.</b><br>A: False sharing occurs when threads modify different variables on the same cache line (typically 64 bytes), causing constant invalidation traffic between cores. Fix: pad or align variables to cache-line boundaries using alignas(64) or __attribute__((aligned(64))).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Why is double-checked locking broken without memory barriers?</b><br>A: The CPU/compiler may reorder the pointer assignment before the constructor completes. Another thread sees a non-null pointer but accesses an uninitialized object. In C++11+, use std::call_once or a function-local static (guaranteed thread-safe).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is the ABA problem?</b><br>A: In lock-free algorithms using CAS, a value changes from A to B and back to A. The CAS succeeds because it sees A, but the underlying data structure has changed. Fix: use a version counter or tagged pointer alongside the value.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: When would you choose a spinlock over a mutex?</b><br>A: Spinlocks are better when the critical section is very short (nanoseconds), contention is low, and threads won\'t be preempted while spinning (e.g., kernel code or pinned threads). For longer critical sections, a mutex avoids wasting CPU cycles.</p></div>',

The cost of sleeping and waking (mutex) exceeds the cost of briefly spinning.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is a recursive mutex?</b><br>A: A recursive mutex allows the same thread to lock it multiple times without deadlocking. It maintains a count; released only when the count reaches zero.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why doesn\'t Peterson\'s algorithm work on modern hardware without modification?</b><br>A: Modern CPUs reorder memory operations for performance.

Detection allows deadlock then finds and breaks it using actual requests.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Deadlock victim selection criteria?</b><br>A: Process priority, computation invested, resources held, how much more needed, and how many times previously chosen as victim (to prevent starvation).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why is Banker\'s not used in most OS?</b><br>A: Three limitations: (1) processes must declare max needs upfront, (2) resources must be fixed, (3) O(n^2*m) cost per request is too high for thousands of requests/second.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Explain Wait-Die vs Wound-Wait.</b><br>A: Both use timestamps. In Wait-Die (non-preemptive): older waits, younger dies. In Wound-Wait (preemptive): older wounds (forces rollback of) younger, younger waits. Both prevent circular wait by enforcing consistent wait direction.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How does a database choose a deadlock victim?</b><br>A: Criteria include: least work done (minimize rollback cost), fewest resources held, lowest priority, and number of times previously victimized (to prevent starvation).

Every memory access on a modern CPU goes through address translation via page tables and the TLB. Understanding paging is essential for diagnosing performance issues like TLB thrashing.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Why Paging?</div><p class="learn-p">Early memory management schemes like <b>contiguous allocation</b> suffer from <b>external fragmentation</b>: as processes are loaded and removed, free memory is broken into small, non-contiguous chunks. Even if total free memory is sufficient, a large process may not fit. <b>Compaction</b> can solve this but is very expensive.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Paging</b> eliminates external fragmentation by dividing both physical memory and logical (virtual) memory into fixed-size blocks:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Page:</b> A fixed-size block of logical (virtual) memory. Typical sizes: 4 KB, 8 KB, 2 MB, 1 GB.</li><li><b>Frame:</b> A fixed-size block of physical memory, same size as a page.</li></ul><p class="learn-p">Any page can be mapped to any frame. The mapping is stored in a <b>page table</b>.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Address Translation</div><p class="learn-p">A logical address generated by the CPU is divided into two parts:</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Component</th><th>Bits</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Page Number (p)</td><td>Higher-order bits</td><td>Index into the page table</td></tr><tr><td>Page Offset (d)</td><td>Lower-order bits</td><td>Offset within the page</td></tr></table><p class="learn-p"><b>Translation process:</b></p><ol class="learn-list"><li>Extract page number <b>p</b> and offset <b>d</b> from the logical address.</li><li>Look up page table entry at index <b>p</b> to get the frame number <b>f</b>.</li><li>Physical address = <b>f * page_size + d</b> (or equivalently, concatenate f and d).</li></ol><div class="learn-code">// Given: page size = 4 KB = 4096 = 2^12\n// Logical address = 0x00003A7F\n// Page number = 0x00003A7F / 4096 = 0x3 (page 3)\n// Offset = 0x00003A7F % 4096 = 0xA7F\n// If page table[3] = frame 6:\n// Physical address = 6 * 4096 + 0xA7F = 0x6A7F</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Page Table Structure</div><p class="learn-p">Each <b>page table entry (PTE)</b> contains:</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Frame Number</td><td>Physical frame where the page resides</td></tr><tr><td>Valid/Invalid Bit</td><td>1 if the page is in memory, 0 if not (page fault if accessed)</td></tr><tr><td>Protection Bits</td><td>Read/Write/Execute permissions</td></tr><tr><td>Dirty Bit (Modified)</td><td>1 if the page has been written to (used during page replacement)</td></tr><tr><td>Reference Bit (Accessed)</td><td>1 if the page has been recently accessed (used by replacement algorithms)</td></tr></table></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)</div><p class="learn-p">Accessing the page table for every memory access doubles the effective memory access time. The <b>TLB</b> is a small, fast, fully associative hardware cache that stores recently used page table entries.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>TLB hit:</b> Frame number is found directly in the TLB (no page table access needed). <b>TLB miss:</b> Must access the page table in memory, and the entry is loaded into the TLB.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Effective Access Time (EAT):</b></p><div class="learn-code">EAT = hit_ratio * (TLB_access + memory_access)\n    + (1 - hit_ratio) * (TLB_access + memory_access + memory_access)\n\n// Example: TLB access = 10ns, Memory access = 100ns, hit ratio = 90%\n// EAT = 0.9 * (10 + 100) + 0.1 * (10 + 100 + 100)\n//     = 0.9 * 110 + 0.1 * 210 = 99 + 21 = 120ns</div><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Typical TLB hit ratios are 95-99% with 64-1024 entries. This makes paging practical despite the overhead.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Multilevel Page Tables</div><p class="learn-p">For a 32-bit address space with 4 KB pages, the page table has 2^20 = 1M entries. At 4 bytes each, that\'s <b>4 MB per process</b> just for the page table &mdash; even if the process only uses a small fraction of its address space.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Two-level page table:</b> The page table itself is paged. The logical address is split into:</p><div class="learn-code">// 32-bit address, 4 KB pages:\n// | 10 bits (outer page) | 10 bits (inner page) | 12 bits (offset) |\n//\n// Step 1: Use outer page number to index into outer page table\n// Step 2: Get the inner page table base address\n// Step 3: Use inner page number to index into inner page table\n// Step 4: Get frame number, combine with offset</div><p class="learn-p">Advantage: Only the outer page table (4 KB) must be in memory. Inner page tables are allocated on demand.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Inverted Page Table</div><p class="learn-p">Instead of one page table per process, an <b>inverted page table</b> has one entry per physical frame. Each entry stores the process ID and page number mapped to that frame. This saves memory (one table for the whole system) but requires searching the table for translation. A hash table is typically used to speed up the search to <span class="learn-complexity">O(1)</span>.</p><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> The inverted page table makes it harder to implement shared memory, because a single frame can only record one (pid, page) pair. Additional structures are needed for sharing.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Copy-on-Write (COW)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Copy-on-Write</b> is an optimization where forked processes share the parent\'s physical pages (marked read-only). Only when one process <b>writes</b> to a shared page does the OS actually copy it:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li>After <code>fork()</code>, parent and child share all physical frames. PTEs are marked <b>read-only</b> with a COW flag.</li><li>When either process writes, a <b>page fault</b> occurs.</li><li>The OS allocates a new frame, copies the page content, updates the writer\'s PTE to the new frame (read-write), and restarts the instruction.</li></ol><p class="learn-p">COW makes <code>fork()</code> nearly free (only copy the page table, not all memory). This is essential for <code>fork()+exec()</code> patterns where the child immediately replaces its address space.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Contiguous Memory Allocation</div><p class="learn-p">Before paging, processes were allocated contiguous blocks of memory. When a process needs memory, the OS finds a hole using one of these strategies:</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Strategy</th><th>Rule</th><th>Pro</th><th>Con</th></tr><tr><td><b>First Fit</b></td><td>Allocate the first hole that is big enough</td><td>Fastest search</td><td>Fragments the beginning of memory</td></tr><tr><td><b>Best Fit</b></td><td>Allocate the smallest hole that is big enough</td><td>Least wasted space per allocation</td><td>Leaves tiny unusable fragments</td></tr><tr><td><b>Worst Fit</b></td><td>Allocate the largest hole</td><td>Leaves larger remaining hole</td><td>Wastes large blocks, generally worst performance</td></tr></table><p class="learn-p"><b>First Fit</b> generally performs best in practice.

Look up page number in page table to get frame number. Physical address = frame_number * page_size + offset.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why do 64-bit systems need multi-level page tables?</b><br>A: A single-level for 48-bit address space with 4 KB pages needs 2^36 entries = 256 GB per process. Multi-level only allocates inner tables for address ranges actually used.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the TLB and why is it critical?</b><br>A: The TLB is a small (64-1024 entry), fully associative hardware cache for page-to-frame mappings. Without TLB, every memory access needs 4 extra accesses on x86-64.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What are huge pages and when to use them?</b><br>A: Huge pages (2 MB or 1 GB) cover more virtual memory per TLB entry. Use for databases, HPC, VMs. Drawback: higher internal fragmentation.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does the inverted page table save memory?</b><br>A: One entry per physical frame (fixed size) instead of one per virtual page per process. Each entry stores (PID, page_number). Translation requires searching (solved with hashing).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does Copy-on-Write make fork() efficient?</b><br>A: After fork(), parent and child share all physical frames (marked read-only). Only when one writes does the OS copy that page. For fork()+exec(), the child replaces its address space immediately, so most pages are never copied.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: Compare First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit allocation.</b><br>A: First Fit: allocate first sufficient hole (fastest, generally best). Best Fit: smallest sufficient hole (least waste per allocation but creates tiny fragments). Worst Fit: largest hole (poor performance). All suffer external fragmentation.</p></div>',

It achieves this by using disk space (swap space) as an extension of RAM.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Key benefits:</b></p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Larger address space:</b> Processes can use more memory than physically available.</li><li><b>Isolation:</b> Each process has its own virtual address space, protected from other processes.</li><li><b>Efficient memory use:</b> Only the actively used pages need to be in RAM; the rest stay on disk.</li><li><b>Simplified linking and loading:</b> Programs can be loaded at any physical address.</li><li><b>Shared libraries:</b> Multiple processes can share the same physical copy of a shared library, each mapping it into their own virtual space.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Demand Paging</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Demand paging</b> is the most common implementation of virtual memory. Pages are loaded into memory <b>only when they are accessed</b> (on demand), not in advance.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Lazy swapper (pager):</b> Never brings a page into memory unless it is needed. Initially, the page table marks all pages as <b>invalid</b>. When a page is accessed:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li>The CPU generates a logical address.</li><li>The MMU checks the page table. If the valid bit is 0 &rarr; <b>page fault</b>.</li><li>The OS traps, finds the page on disk, loads it into a free frame, updates the page table (valid = 1, frame number set), and restarts the instruction.</li></ol><div class="learn-code">// Page fault handling pseudocode:\n1. Trap to OS\n2. Save user registers and process state\n3. Determine that the interrupt was a page fault\n4. Check that the page reference was legal\n5. Find a free frame (or use page replacement)\n6. Schedule disk I/O to read the page into the frame\n7. When I/O completes, update the page table\n8. Restart the instruction that caused the page fault</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Performance of Demand Paging</div><p class="learn-p">The effective access time with demand paging depends on the <b>page fault rate (p)</b>:</p><div class="learn-code">EAT = (1 - p) * memory_access_time + p * page_fault_service_time\n\n// Typical values:\n// memory_access_time = 200 ns\n// page_fault_service_time = 8 ms = 8,000,000 ns\n//\n// If p = 1/1000 (0.001):\n// EAT = 0.999 * 200 + 0.001 * 8,000,000\n//     = 199.8 + 8,000 = 8,199.8 ns (40x slowdown!)\n//\n// To keep slowdown under 10%:\n// 220 > (1-p)*200 + p*8,000,000\n// 20 > p * 7,999,800\n// p < 0.0000025 (less than 1 fault per 400,000 accesses)</div><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> Page faults are <b>extremely expensive</b> due to disk I/O. Even a very small page fault rate can significantly degrade performance. This is why good page replacement algorithms and sufficient RAM are critical.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Swap Space</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Swap space</b> is the disk area used as an extension of physical memory. When RAM is full, the OS moves (swaps out) less-used pages to swap and brings them back (swaps in) on demand.</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Swap partition vs swap file:</b> A dedicated partition gives contiguous disk access (faster). A swap file is more flexible (can resize). Linux supports both.</li><li><b>Sizing:</b> Traditional rule: swap = 2&times; RAM. Modern: depends on workload. Servers with large RAM may use little swap; hibernation requires swap &ge; RAM size.</li><li><b>Swappiness (Linux):</b> <code>vm.swappiness</code> (0-100) controls how aggressively the kernel swaps. 0 = avoid swapping (prefer dropping page cache), 100 = swap eagerly.

Cheaper than disk fault but still ~1 &mu;s.</li><li><b>Overcommit:</b> Linux by default allows processes to allocate more virtual memory than physically available (RAM + swap).

Minor is resolved without disk I/O: page is in page cache, or it is a zero-fill or COW copy (~1-10 &mu;s).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How does COW make fork() efficient?</b><br>A: After fork(), parent and child share all physical pages, marked read-only. Only when either writes does the OS copy that single page. If child immediately calls exec(), most pages are never copied.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Calculate EAT with p=0.001, memory=200ns, fault=10ms.</b><br>A: EAT = (1-p)*200 + p*10,000,000 = 199.8 + 10,000 = 10,199.8 ns. A 51x slowdown from just 0.1% fault rate!</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is memory-mapped I/O?</b><br>A: mmap() maps a file into virtual address space. Contents are demand-paged: on access, a page fault loads the file page. Subsequent accesses hit the page cache. Enables zero-copy sharing.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why must the OS zero pages before giving to new processes?</b><br>A: Security: without zeroing, a process could read data left by a terminated process. The OS uses demand zeroing: pages zeroed on first access, spreading cost over time.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does Linux reclaim memory under pressure?</b><br>A: kswapd runs in the background when free memory drops below watermarks. It scans the inactive list for pages to evict. File-backed clean pages are dropped; dirty pages are written back first. Anonymous pages go to swap. If reclamation fails, the OOM killer terminates a process.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is memory overcommit and why does Linux allow it?</b><br>A: Overcommit lets processes allocate more virtual memory than physical RAM + swap. This works because most allocated memory is never fully used (e.g., malloc 1GB but only touch 100MB). The risk: if too many processes actually use their allocation, the OOM killer intervenes.</p></div>',

Root cause: the sum of all processes\' working sets exceeds available physical memory.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How does the Working Set model prevent thrashing?</b><br>A: It tracks which pages each process accessed in the last delta time units. If total demand exceeds frames, the OS suspends a process to free memory.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the Page Fault Frequency strategy?</b><br>A: PFF monitors each process\'s fault rate directly. If rate exceeds upper threshold, allocate more frames. If below lower threshold, reclaim frames. If no free frames, suspend a process.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Global vs local page replacement and thrashing?</b><br>A: Global: one process\'s faults can cause another to lose pages, creating cascading effects. Local: each process can only evict its own pages, isolating processes but potentially wasting memory.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How to diagnose thrashing on a production server?</b><br>A: Look for: high swap I/O (vmstat si/so), low CPU utilization despite load, high page fault rate (sar -B), high I/O wait. Resolution: add RAM, reduce processes, optimize memory usage, or use SSDs.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why does global replacement generally outperform local replacement?</b><br>A: Global replacement lets the system give free frames to whichever process needs them most, improving overall throughput. Local replacement can leave frames idle in processes that don\'t need them while others thrash. However, global replacement is less predictable per-process.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How does row-major vs column-major array access affect page faults?</b><br>A: In C (row-major), accessing a[i][j] by varying j (inner loop over columns) follows spatial locality — consecutive elements are in the same page. Accessing by varying i (inner loop over rows) jumps across pages, causing many more page faults for large arrays.</p></div>',

Variants: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT.</p><p class="learn-p">The <b>File Allocation Table</b> is a table with one entry per disk block.

Common directory structures:</p><p class="learn-p"><b>1. Single-Level Directory:</b> All files in one directory. Simple but name collisions are problematic with multiple users.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>2. Two-Level Directory:</b> Each user has their own directory. Isolates users but no logical grouping within a user\'s files.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>3. Tree-Structured Directory:</b> Hierarchical directory tree (what we use today). Users can create subdirectories. Files are identified by their <b>absolute path</b> (from root) or <b>relative path</b> (from current directory).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>4. Acyclic-Graph Directory:</b> Allows shared subdirectories and files (via hard links or symbolic links). Must handle deletion carefully (reference counting for hard links).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>5. General Graph Directory:</b> Allows cycles. Problematic because file system traversals (e.g., backup) may loop forever. Garbage collection needed to reclaim unreferenced files.</p><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> Unix prevents hard links to directories (except for <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>) specifically to avoid cycles in the directory graph. Symbolic links can create apparent cycles, but the OS handles this with a maximum symlink resolution depth.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">ext4 File System Features</div><p class="learn-p"><b>ext4</b> is the default Linux file system.

Deleting the original does not affect it. A symbolic link is a separate file containing the PATH. Deleting the target makes the symlink dangle. Hard links cannot cross file systems; symlinks can.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why is the file name not stored in the inode?</b><br>A: Separating names from metadata enables hard links: multiple entries can point to the same inode. Renaming is O(1) and does not touch the inode.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What happens when you delete a file in Unix?</b><br>A: Directory entry removed, inode link count decremented. If count reaches 0 AND no process has it open, inode and blocks are freed.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is journaling?</b><br>A: Journaling logs metadata changes before applying them. On crash, the journal is replayed for consistency. Without it, a full fsck scan is needed (can take hours).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does FAT differ from inode-based systems?</b><br>A: FAT uses a single table mapping each block to the next in a chain. No inode, no permissions, no hard links, no journaling. Its simplicity makes it universal for removable media.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What happens when you delete an open file in Unix?</b><br>A: The directory entry is removed and the link count drops to 0, but the inode and data blocks are NOT freed until the last file descriptor referencing the file is closed. The process can continue reading/writing normally.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How does ext4 journaling provide crash recovery?</b><br>A: Before writing metadata to its final location, ext4 writes the change to a journal (write-ahead log). On crash, the journal is replayed: complete entries are applied, incomplete ones are discarded. This avoids the need for a full fsck scan.</p></div>',

Head at 53, requests: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67.</b><br>A: From 53: 65(12), 67(2), 37(30), 14(23), 98(84), 122(24), 124(2), 183(59). Total = 236.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why is C-SCAN preferred over SCAN for heavy disk load?</b><br>A: SCAN services requests on both sweeps, so tracks near the reversal point are served twice quickly. C-SCAN only services in one direction, providing more uniform wait times.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Is disk scheduling relevant for SSDs?</b><br>A: No. SSDs have no mechanical seek. Linux uses noop or mq-deadline schedulers that focus on preventing starvation rather than minimizing seek distance.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: SCAN vs LOOK?</b><br>A: SCAN moves to the disk end before reversing. LOOK reverses at the last actual request, saving unnecessary travel.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does NCQ interact with OS scheduling?</b><br>A: NCQ allows HDD firmware to accept up to 32 commands and reorder them internally for optimal head movement. The OS provides coarse-grained ordering; NCQ fine-tunes execution.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Calculate FCFS seek distance.

Deadline schedulers focus on preventing request starvation with read/write deadlines, and have minimal CPU overhead — important when SSDs can handle 100K+ IOPS.</p></div>',

Read performance of RAID 0, write performance without parity computation, survives one failure per mirror pair. Standard for MySQL, PostgreSQL. Trade-off: 50% capacity loss.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Explain the RAID 5 write penalty.</b><br>A: To write one block: (1) read old data, (2) read old parity, (3) compute new parity = old_parity XOR old_data XOR new_data, (4) write new data, (5) write new parity. 4 I/O ops for 1 logical write.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Why is RAID 6 becoming more important as disks grow?</b><br>A: Larger disks take longer to rebuild. During rebuild, remaining disks are stressed, increasing chance of a second failure. RAID 5 cannot survive that; RAID 6 can.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How does parity work in RAID 5?</b><br>A: Parity = XOR of all data blocks in a stripe. Any missing value recovered by XORing remaining values with parity. Parity distributed across all disks to avoid bottleneck.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: RAID 10 vs RAID 01?</b><br>A: RAID 10: first mirror, then stripe. RAID 01: first stripe, then mirror. RAID 10 is superior: a single failure degrades only one mirror pair. In RAID 01, a failure degrades an entire stripe set.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why is RAID not a substitute for backups?</b><br>A: RAID protects against hardware failure only. It does NOT protect against accidental deletion, software corruption, ransomware, or site-wide disasters. A deleted file is instantly deleted on all RAID mirrors. Backups provide point-in-time recovery.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is a RAID rebuild storm and why is it dangerous?</b><br>A: After a disk fails in RAID 5, the array must reconstruct the failed disk\'s data by reading every other disk. During this rebuild (which can take hours with large disks), all remaining disks are under heavy stress, increasing the chance of a second failure — which would cause total data loss.</p></div>',

The Application layer creates data; Transport adds TCP/UDP header (segment); Network adds IP header (packet); Data Link adds MAC addresses and CRC (frame); Physical converts to bits. De-encapsulation is the reverse at the receiving end — each layer strips its header and passes the payload up.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why is ARP needed if we already have IP addresses?</b><br>A: IP addresses identify hosts logically across networks, but within a local network segment, frames are delivered using MAC addresses. ARP bridges this gap by resolving an IP address to the corresponding MAC address on the same subnet. Without ARP, a host would know the destination IP but not the physical address needed to construct the Ethernet frame.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Can a network use only the OSI model without TCP/IP?</b><br>A: The OSI model is a reference/conceptual framework, not a protocol suite. The Internet uses the TCP/IP protocol suite. However, the OSI model\'s layer terminology (e.g., "Layer 7 firewall," "Layer 3 switch") is universally used by network engineers even when discussing TCP/IP-based networks.</p></div>',

Shannon gives the theoretical maximum for a <b>noisy</b> channel: C = B log2(1 + SNR). Shannon\'s limit is absolute — no encoding can exceed it. Nyquist tells you how many signal levels you need; Shannon tells you whether that\'s physically achievable given noise.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why does Manchester encoding require twice the bandwidth?</b><br>A: Each bit period has a guaranteed transition (low-to-high or high-to-low) in the middle. This means the signal changes at twice the data rate, requiring twice the bandwidth. The tradeoff is self-clocking capability — the receiver extracts the clock from the transitions, eliminating clock skew.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Compare FDM, TDM, and WDM.</b><br>A: FDM divides the channel by frequency (each user gets a frequency band). TDM divides by time (each user gets a time slot). WDM is FDM for fiber optics (each user gets a light wavelength). FDM wastes bandwidth on guard bands; synchronous TDM wastes unused slots; WDM is the most efficient for fiber (DWDM carries 80+ channels).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: A channel has bandwidth 4 kHz and SNR of 24 dB. What is the maximum achievable data rate?</b><br>A: SNR_linear = 10^(24/10) = 251.19. Shannon: C = 4000 &times; log2(252.19) = 4000 &times; 7.98 = 31,920 bps. With Nyquist (L signal levels): to achieve this with 2B&times;log2(L), need log2(L) = 31920/8000 &asymp; 3.99, so L = 16. Answer: ~31,920 bps using 16 signal levels.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is the difference between bit rate and baud rate?</b><br>A: Baud rate is the number of signal changes per second. Bit rate is the number of bits transmitted per second. Bit rate = baud rate &times; bits_per_symbol. They are equal only for binary signaling (2 levels). With QAM-16 (4 bits/symbol), bit rate = 4 &times; baud rate.</p></div>',

Multi-mode has a larger core (~50-62.5 &mu;m), uses LED/VCSEL, supports up to ~2 km but suffers from modal dispersion — used in LANs and data centers. Single-mode is more expensive but essential for long-haul.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why does star topology dominate modern LANs?</b><br>A: Star topology provides easy fault isolation (one cable failure affects only one device), simple addition/removal of devices, and when used with a switch (not hub), eliminates collisions entirely. The only weakness is the central switch being a single point of failure, which is mitigated with redundant switches.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the difference between a hub, a switch, and a router?</b><br>A: A hub operates at Layer 1 and broadcasts all frames to all ports — creating one large collision domain. A switch operates at Layer 2 and uses a MAC address table to forward frames only to the correct port — each port is a separate collision domain. A router operates at Layer 3 and routes packets between different networks using IP addresses — each interface is a separate broadcast domain.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Why do some HFT firms prefer microwave over fiber for inter-exchange links?</b><br>A: Microwaves travel at the speed of light in air (~3 x 10^8 m/s) whereas light in fiber travels at ~2 x 10^8 m/s due to the refractive index of glass. This ~33% speed advantage translates to microseconds of latency savings on routes like Chicago-to-New Jersey, which is significant in high-frequency trading.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How many links are needed in a full mesh topology with n nodes? Why is full mesh impractical for large networks?</b><br>A: Full mesh requires n(n-1)/2 links. For 10 nodes that is 45 links; for 100 nodes, 4950 links. The O(n^2) growth makes full mesh impractical for large networks. Instead, partial mesh or spine-leaf architectures connect only critical nodes fully, balancing redundancy with cost.</p></div>',

A single flipped bit in a dollar amount — say changing $1,000,000 to $3,000,000 — could cause catastrophic errors. <b>Error detection</b> at the Data Link layer catches these corruptions before they propagate. <b>Flow control</b> ensures a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver, which is critical in high-frequency trading systems where data bursts are common. Understanding CRC, Hamming codes, and sliding window protocols is essential for both networking interviews and systems design.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Introduction to Error Detection</div><p class="learn-p">When data is transmitted over a physical medium (copper wire, fiber, wireless), <b>noise and interference</b> can corrupt bits. The <b>Data Link Layer</b> is responsible for detecting (and sometimes correcting) these errors before passing data up to the Network Layer. Error detection ensures <b>data integrity</b> at the frame level.</p><p class="learn-p">There are two broad strategies: <b>Error Detection</b> (detect and request retransmission) and <b>Error Correction</b> (detect and fix without retransmission, also called <b>Forward Error Correction / FEC</b>). In practice, most wired networks rely on detection + retransmission, while wireless or satellite links may use FEC due to high latency.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Types of Errors</div><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Single-bit error:</b> Only one bit in the data unit is flipped. Rare in serial transmission but possible.</li><li><b>Burst error:</b> Two or more consecutive bits are corrupted. More common in real-world channels. The <b>burst length</b> is from the first to the last corrupted bit.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Error Detection Techniques</div><p class="learn-p"><b>1. Parity Check (Single Bit Parity):</b></p><p class="learn-p">A <b>parity bit</b> is appended to the data. In <b>even parity</b>, the total number of 1s (data + parity) is made even. In <b>odd parity</b>, it is made odd.</p><div class="learn-code">Data: 1011001  (four 1s — even count)\nEven Parity Bit: 0  &rarr; 10110010  (still four 1s)\nOdd Parity Bit:  1  &rarr; 10110011  (five 1s)</div><p class="learn-p">Single-bit parity can detect <b>odd number of bit errors</b> but fails for even number of errors. It cannot correct errors.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>2. Two-Dimensional Parity:</b></p><p class="learn-p">Data is arranged in a matrix. Parity is computed for each row AND each column. This can detect <b>all single-bit, double-bit, and all triple-bit errors</b>. It can also <b>correct single-bit errors</b> by identifying the row and column intersection.</p><div class="learn-code">Data Matrix:        Row Parity:\n1 0 1 1  |  1\n0 1 1 0  |  0\n1 1 0 1  |  1\n---------+\n0 0 0 0    (column parity)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>3. Checksum:</b></p><p class="learn-p">Used at the Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and also at the Network layer (IP header checksum). The sender divides data into fixed-size segments, sums them using <b>1\'s complement arithmetic</b>, and sends the complement of the sum as the checksum. The receiver adds all segments + checksum; if the result is all 1s, no error is detected.</p><div class="learn-code">Segments: 10011001, 11100010, 00100100\nSum (1\'s complement): 10011001 + 11100010 = 101111011\nWrap carry: 01111100\nAdd next:   01111100 + 00100100 = 10100000\nChecksum = complement = 01011111</div><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> Checksum can miss errors where two segments have complementary bit flips that cancel out in the sum. CRC is more robust for link-layer error detection.</div><p class="learn-p"><b>4. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):</b></p><p class="learn-p">CRC is the <b>most widely used</b> error detection method at the Data Link layer (used in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB, etc.). It treats the bit string as a polynomial and divides it by a <b>generator polynomial</b>. The remainder is appended to the data as the CRC code.</p><div class="learn-code">Data:       1101011011  (message M)\nGenerator:  10011       (polynomial G, degree 4)\n\nStep 1: Append (degree of G) zeros to M:\n        11010110110000\nStep 2: Divide by G using XOR (modulo-2 division)\nStep 3: Remainder = 1110  (this is the CRC)\nStep 4: Transmit: 11010110111110\n\nReceiver divides received data by G.\nIf remainder = 0, no error detected.</div><p class="learn-p">CRC can detect: all single-bit errors, all double-bit errors (if G has at least 3 terms), all odd number of errors (if G contains x+1 as factor), and all burst errors of length up to the CRC degree.</p><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Common CRC polynomials: CRC-8, CRC-16, CRC-32 (used in Ethernet with generator 0x04C11DB7). CRC-32 can detect any burst error of length &le; 32.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Hamming Code (Error Correction)</div><p class="learn-p">Hamming code is a <b>Forward Error Correction (FEC)</b> technique that can <b>detect up to 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors</b>. It uses <b>redundant parity bits</b> placed at positions that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).</p><p class="learn-p">For a data word of <b>m</b> bits, we need <b>r</b> redundant bits such that <code>2^r &ge; m + r + 1</code>.

Which is most robust?</b><br>A: Parity can detect odd numbers of bit errors but misses even numbers. Checksum (1\'s complement sum) can miss complementary errors that cancel out. CRC treats data as a polynomial and uses modulo-2 division; it catches all single-bit, all double-bit, all odd-bit, and all burst errors of length up to the CRC degree. CRC-32 (used in Ethernet) is the most robust of the three.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why is the maximum window size for Go-Back-N = 2^n - 1 but for Selective Repeat = 2^(n-1)?</b><br>A: In GBN, the receiver window is 1 so there\'s no ambiguity between new and retransmitted frames as long as sender window &le; 2^n - 1. In SR, both sender and receiver have window size W. If W were too large, the receiver could mistake retransmitted frames for new ones when sequence numbers wrap around. The constraint sender_W + receiver_W &le; 2^n, with both equal, gives W &le; 2^(n-1).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the efficiency of Stop-and-Wait when propagation delay is 10x the transmission delay?</b><br>A: Efficiency = 1/(1 + 2a) where a = t_prop/t_trans = 10. So efficiency = 1/21 = 4.76%. This shows Stop-and-Wait is very inefficient on high-latency links.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How does Hamming code correct single-bit errors?</b><br>A: Parity bits at positions 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. each cover specific bit positions. On receiving, the receiver recalculates each parity bit. The positions where parity fails form a binary number pointing to the error position. For example, if P1 and P4 fail, the error is at position 1+4 = 5.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is piggybacking in flow control?</b><br>A: In full-duplex communication, instead of sending a separate ACK frame, the acknowledgment is attached to an outgoing data frame headed in the reverse direction. This reduces the number of frames on the network and improves bandwidth utilization.</p></div>',

The <b>MAC sublayer</b> decides who gets to transmit and when, preventing chaos from simultaneous transmissions. Understanding CSMA/CD explains why Ethernet has a 64-byte minimum frame size, and CSMA/CA explains why your Wi-Fi throughput drops in crowded environments. These concepts appear frequently in networking interviews and are fundamental to understanding LAN performance.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Introduction to MAC (Medium Access Control)</div><p class="learn-p">When multiple devices share a common communication channel (e.g., a bus topology, wireless medium), we need a mechanism to decide <b>who gets to transmit and when</b>. The <b>MAC sublayer</b> of the Data Link Layer handles this. MAC protocols are critical for avoiding <b>collisions</b> — situations where two or more stations transmit simultaneously, corrupting each other\'s signals.</p><p class="learn-p">MAC protocols are broadly classified into three categories:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>Random Access (Contention-based):</b> Any station can transmit at any time. Collisions are possible and handled. Examples: ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA.</li><li><b>Controlled Access:</b> Stations take turns or get permission. Examples: Polling, Token Passing, Reservation.</li><li><b>Channelization:</b> The channel is divided among stations. Examples: FDMA, TDMA, CDMA.</li></ol></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">ALOHA Protocols</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Pure ALOHA:</b> Stations transmit whenever they have data. If a collision occurs (detected by lack of ACK), the station waits a <b>random backoff time</b> and retransmits.</p><div class="learn-code">Vulnerable period = 2 * T_frame\nMax throughput = 1/(2e) ≈ 18.4% at load G = 0.5\nS = G * e^(-2G)</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Slotted ALOHA:</b> Time is divided into slots equal to one frame transmission time. Stations can only transmit at the <b>beginning of a slot</b>. This halves the vulnerable period.</p><div class="learn-code">Vulnerable period = T_frame  (halved!)\nMax throughput = 1/e ≈ 36.8% at load G = 1.0\nS = G * e^(-G)</div><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> Slotted ALOHA doubles the throughput of Pure ALOHA by reducing the vulnerable period.

If the channel is busy, the station defers. There are three persistence strategies:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>1-Persistent CSMA:</b> If channel is idle, transmit immediately. If busy, keep sensing and transmit as soon as it becomes idle. High collision probability.</li><li><b>Non-Persistent CSMA:</b> If channel is busy, wait a random time before sensing again. Lower collision rate but higher delay.</li><li><b>p-Persistent CSMA:</b> If channel is idle, transmit with probability <b>p</b> and defer with probability <b>1-p</b>.

The minimum frame must take at least 2 * propagation_delay to transmit. For 10 Mbps Ethernet with max 2500m cable: RTT ~51.2 us, so min frame = 51.2 us * 10 Mbps = 512 bits = 64 bytes.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why can\'t CSMA/CD be used in wireless networks?</b><br>A: Due to the <b>hidden terminal problem</b> — station A may not hear station C\'s transmission (C is out of range), so A thinks the channel is free and transmits, colliding at station B. Also, wireless signal strength drops dramatically with distance, making collision detection unreliable. CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS solves this.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: How does a switch learn MAC addresses?</b><br>A: When a frame arrives on a port, the switch reads the <b>source MAC address</b> and records it in the <b>CAM table</b>. When forwarding, it looks up the destination MAC. If found, it sends only to that port (unicast). If not found, it floods the frame to all ports except the source port. Entries expire after a timeout (typically 300 seconds).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is Binary Exponential Backoff?</b><br>A: After a collision in CSMA/CD, the station chooses a random wait from [0, 2^min(n,10) - 1] slot times, where n is the collision count. The exponential growth spreads out retransmission attempts, reducing repeated collisions. After 16 failures, the transmission is aborted.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is the difference between a collision domain and a broadcast domain?</b><br>A: A collision domain is a segment where simultaneous transmissions collide. A hub creates one large collision domain; a switch creates separate collision domains per port. A broadcast domain is where a broadcast frame reaches all devices. Switches do NOT separate broadcast domains — only routers or VLANs do.</p></div>',

SR: W_max = 2^(3-1) = 4. With 3 bits we have sequence numbers 0-7 (8 values). GBN needs W &le; 7 to avoid confusing retransmitted frames with new ones.

It sends duplicate ACKs for frame 2. When the sender\'s timer for frame 3 expires, it retransmits ALL frames from 3 onward.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Why does Selective Repeat need receiver buffering but GBN does not?</b><br>A: In SR, the receiver accepts out-of-order frames and stores them in a buffer until the missing frame arrives. GBN\'s receiver simply discards out-of-order frames. SR trades receiver complexity for better bandwidth utilization on lossy links.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is the bandwidth-delay product and how does it relate to window size?</b><br>A: BDP = bandwidth * RTT, representing the maximum data "in flight." For full utilization, the window size (in bits) must be &ge; BDP. High-BDP links (satellite, transcontinental) need large windows. This is why TCP uses window scaling.</p></div>',

Bellman-Ford (RIP) works distributedly, each router only needs neighbor info, O(VE). Dijkstra converges faster; Bellman-Ford is simpler but prone to count-to-infinity.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: What is the count-to-infinity problem?</b><br>A: When a link fails in distance vector networks, routers keep incrementing the metric in a loop. Solutions: Split Horizon, Poison Reverse, Triggered Updates, Hold-Down Timer.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is longest prefix match?</b><br>A: When multiple routing entries match, the router uses the most specific (longest) prefix. For 10.1.1.50 with entries /8, /16, /24 — /24 wins. Enables hierarchical aggregation with exceptions.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Why does BGP use TCP while OSPF runs on IP?</b><br>A: BGP peers can be multiple hops apart and need reliable delivery, making TCP (port 179) appropriate. OSPF operates within an AS with directly connected neighbors and uses its own reliability on IP (protocol 89).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What caused the Facebook 2021 outage?</b><br>A: A maintenance command accidentally withdrew all BGP route advertisements. DNS servers inside Facebook\'s network became unreachable. Engineers couldn\'t remotely fix it (network was down) and had to physically access data centers. Outage lasted ~6 hours.</p></div>',

The receiver advertises its available buffer space via the <b>Window Size</b> field (also called <b>rwnd</b> — receiver window). The sender must not send more unacknowledged data than the receiver window allows.</p><div class="learn-code">Sender\'s effective window = min(cwnd, rwnd)\n\nExample:\n  Receiver buffer = 4000 bytes\n  Receiver has 1000 bytes unread\n  rwnd = 4000 - 1000 = 3000 bytes\n\n  Sender can send up to 3000 bytes of unACKed data.</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Zero Window:</b> If the receiver\'s buffer is full, it advertises <b>rwnd = 0</b>. The sender stops sending data but periodically sends <b>Window Probe</b> segments (1 byte) to check if the window has opened. This prevents <b>deadlock</b>.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Silly Window Syndrome:</b> When the receiver frees only a tiny amount of buffer and advertises a small window, leading to many tiny segments. Solutions:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Nagle\'s Algorithm (sender-side):</b> Buffer small segments and send when either (a) enough data to fill MSS, or (b) ACK for previous data received.</li><li><b>Clark\'s Solution / Delayed ACK (receiver-side):</b> Don\'t advertise a small window; wait until the buffer has at least MSS or half the buffer free.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">TCP Retransmission</div><p class="learn-p">TCP ensures reliability via <b>retransmission</b>. Two mechanisms trigger retransmission:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>Timeout (RTO):</b> If an ACK is not received within the <b>Retransmission Timeout</b>, the segment is retransmitted. RTO is dynamically calculated using SRTT (Smoothed Round-Trip Time) and RTTVAR (RTT Variance).</li><li><b>Fast Retransmit:</b> If the sender receives <b>3 duplicate ACKs</b> for the same sequence number, it retransmits the missing segment immediately without waiting for timeout.</li></ol><div class="learn-code">RTO Calculation (Jacobson\'s Algorithm):\nSRTT = (1 - &alpha;) * SRTT + &alpha; * RTT_sample     (&alpha; = 1/8)\nRTTVAR = (1 - &beta;) * RTTVAR + &beta; * |SRTT - RTT_sample|  (&beta; = 1/4)\nRTO = SRTT + 4 * RTTVAR\n\nOn timeout: RTO is doubled (exponential backoff)</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">TCP Window Scaling &amp; SACK</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Window Scaling (RFC 7323):</b> The 16-bit Window Size field limits rwnd to 65,535 bytes — far too small for high-bandwidth links. The <b>Window Scale option</b> is negotiated during the 3-way handshake: each side declares a scale factor (0-14). The actual window = Window Size &lt;&lt; scale factor, supporting windows up to <b>~1 GB</b>.</p><div class="learn-code">During handshake:\n  Client SYN:     Window Scale = 7  (window values shifted left 7)\n  Server SYN-ACK: Window Scale = 9\n\nDuring data transfer:\n  Window Size field = 500, Scale = 7\n  Actual rwnd = 500 &lt;&lt; 7 = 64,000 bytes\n\nWithout scaling: max window = 65,535 bytes\n  At 100 Mbps, 50ms RTT: throughput ≤ 65,535 / 0.05 = ~10 Mbps (wastes 90%!)\nWith scaling: window can match bandwidth-delay product</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Selective ACK (SACK, RFC 2018):</b> Standard TCP uses <b>cumulative ACKs</b> — acknowledging up to the first gap. If segments 1,2,4,5 arrive and 3 is lost, the receiver can only ACK up to 2. The sender must guess what else is missing. SACK adds an option that reports exactly which byte ranges have been received, so the sender retransmits <b>only</b> the lost segments.</p><div class="learn-code">Without SACK (cumulative only):\n  Received: [1][2][_][4][5]  → ACK 3 (gap at 3)\n  Sender doesn\'t know 4,5 arrived → may retransmit 3,4,5\n\nWith SACK:\n  Received: [1][2][_][4][5]  → ACK 3, SACK: 4-5\n  Sender knows only 3 is missing → retransmit just segment 3\n\nSACK is negotiated during handshake (SACK Permitted option)\nand reported in subsequent ACKs (up to 3-4 SACK blocks per ACK).</div><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> SACK is enabled by default on virtually all modern OS (Linux, Windows, macOS). It dramatically improves performance when multiple segments are lost in one window — a common scenario on wireless and lossy networks.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: Walk through the TCP 3-way handshake with sequence numbers.</b><br>A: (1) Client sends SYN with ISN=1000. (2) Server responds SYN+ACK: seq=5000, ack=1001. (3) Client sends ACK: seq=1001, ack=5001. SYN consumes one sequence number, hence ACK = ISN+1. Connection ESTABLISHED.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why does TCP need TIME_WAIT? Why 2*MSL?</b><br>A: Ensures (1) final ACK reaches server (if lost, server retransmits FIN), (2) old duplicate segments expire before port reuse. 2*MSL (typically 60s total) guarantees any segment from this connection is discarded.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What happens when rwnd = 0?</b><br>A: Sender stops transmitting but sends periodic <b>Window Probe</b> segments (1-byte) to check if window reopened. Prevents deadlock if receiver\'s window update is lost.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is Silly Window Syndrome?</b><br>A: Receiver advertises tiny windows, causing many small segments with high overhead. Solutions: Nagle\'s Algorithm (buffer small data at sender), Clark\'s Solution (receiver waits until buffer has MSS free), Delayed ACK.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How is RTO calculated?</b><br>A: Jacobson\'s algorithm: SRTT = (1-1/8)*SRTT + (1/8)*RTT_sample. RTTVAR = (1-1/4)*RTTVAR + (1/4)*|SRTT - RTT_sample|. RTO = SRTT + 4*RTTVAR. On timeout, RTO doubles (exponential backoff).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Difference between FIN_WAIT_2 and CLOSE_WAIT?</b><br>A: FIN_WAIT_2: active closer sent FIN, received ACK, waiting for other side\'s FIN. CLOSE_WAIT: passive closer received FIN, ACKed it, can still send data. CLOSE_WAIT pileup usually means application is not closing sockets.</p></div>',

TCP congestion control, developed by Van Jacobson, solved this existential threat. Understanding <b>slow start, congestion avoidance, and AIMD</b> explains why downloads ramp up gradually, why Netflix uses TCP BBR, and why UDP is preferred for real-time trading feeds where retransmission is worse than packet loss.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Why Congestion Control?</div><p class="learn-p">While <b>flow control</b> prevents the sender from overwhelming the <b>receiver</b>, <b>congestion control</b> prevents the sender from overwhelming the <b>network</b>. When too many packets are injected into the network, routers\' buffers overflow, causing packet loss, increased delays, and potential <b>congestion collapse</b> (throughput drops to near zero despite high load).</p><p class="learn-p">TCP congestion control is <b>end-to-end</b> — the sender infers congestion from packet loss (timeout or duplicate ACKs) and adjusts its sending rate accordingly using a <b>congestion window (cwnd)</b>.</p><div class="learn-code">Effective sending rate = min(cwnd, rwnd) / RTT\n\ncwnd: sender\'s congestion window (network capacity)\nrwnd: receiver\'s advertised window (receiver capacity)\nThe sender always uses the smaller of the two.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">TCP Congestion Control Phases</div><p class="learn-p">TCP uses four main algorithms for congestion control, often collectively called <b>TCP Tahoe/Reno</b>:</p><p class="learn-p"><b>1. Slow Start:</b></p><ul class="learn-list"><li>Initial <code>cwnd = 1 MSS</code> (Maximum Segment Size, typically 1460 bytes).</li><li><code>cwnd</code> <b>doubles every RTT</b> (exponential growth): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...</li><li>Actually: cwnd increases by 1 MSS for every ACK received.</li><li>Continues until <code>cwnd</code> reaches <b>ssthresh</b> (slow start threshold), then switches to Congestion Avoidance.</li></ul><p class="learn-p"><b>2. Congestion Avoidance:</b></p><ul class="learn-list"><li>When <code>cwnd &ge; ssthresh</code>, growth becomes <b>linear</b> (additive increase).</li><li><code>cwnd</code> increases by <b>1 MSS per RTT</b> (not per ACK).</li><li>Implementation: <code>cwnd += MSS * MSS / cwnd</code> for each ACK.</li></ul><p class="learn-p"><b>3. Fast Retransmit:</b></p><ul class="learn-list"><li>When sender receives <b>3 duplicate ACKs</b>, it retransmits the lost segment immediately (without waiting for timeout).</li><li>3 dup ACKs indicate that some segments after the lost one arrived — network is still delivering, so congestion is not catastrophic.</li></ul><p class="learn-p"><b>4. Fast Recovery (TCP Reno only):</b></p><ul class="learn-list"><li>After fast retransmit, set <code>ssthresh = cwnd/2</code> and <code>cwnd = ssthresh</code>, then enter Congestion Avoidance.</li><li><b>RFC 5681 detail:</b> Technically, cwnd is temporarily inflated to <code>ssthresh + 3 MSS</code> (accounting for the 3 segments that triggered dup ACKs), and each further dup ACK adds 1 MSS. When a new ACK arrives, cwnd <b>deflates</b> to ssthresh.

The session layer controls which mode is used for a given dialog.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Compare cookie-based sessions with JWT tokens.</b><br>A: Cookies are stateful — the server stores session data and the cookie is just an ID. Easy to revoke (delete from server store). JWT is stateless — the token contains the claims, signed by the server. No server-side storage needed (scalable), but hard to revoke before expiry. Use cookies for traditional web apps; JWT for APIs and microservices.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What are synchronization points in the Session Layer?</b><br>A: Checkpoints inserted into a data stream during long transfers. If a failure occurs, the session can resume from the last checkpoint instead of starting over. Two types: major sync points (require acknowledgment) and minor sync points (no acknowledgment needed). Analogous to save points in a database transaction.</p></div>',

Asymmetric uses a key pair (RSA, ECC) — slow but solves key distribution. In practice, TLS uses asymmetric to exchange a symmetric session key, then symmetric for bulk encryption. For n parties: symmetric needs n(n-1)/2 keys; asymmetric needs 2n.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why is ECB mode insecure?</b><br>A: ECB encrypts each block independently with the same key. Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns in the data. The ECB penguin example shows an image encrypted with ECB retains the original outline. Use CBC, CTR, or GCM instead.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Explain the TLS 1.3 handshake.</b><br>A: 1-RTT handshake: Client sends ClientHello (supported ciphers + ECDHE key share). Server responds with ServerHello (chosen cipher + key share + certificate + signature). Both derive the session key using ECDHE. Subsequent data is encrypted with AES-GCM or ChaCha20. Forward secrecy is guaranteed by ephemeral keys.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is forward secrecy and why does it matter?</b><br>A: Forward secrecy ensures that compromising the server\'s long-term private key doesn\'t compromise past sessions. Achieved using ephemeral key exchange (ECDHE) — each session generates new key pairs that are discarded after use. Without forward secrecy (static RSA), an attacker who obtains the private key can decrypt all recorded traffic.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does a digital signature work?</b><br>A: The sender hashes the message (SHA-256), then encrypts the hash with their private key — this is the signature. The receiver decrypts the signature with the sender\'s public key to get the hash, then independently hashes the message and compares. If they match: the message is authentic (came from the sender), has integrity (wasn\'t modified), and is non-repudiable (sender can\'t deny signing it).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why is MD5 considered broken?</b><br>A: Researchers demonstrated practical collision attacks — two different inputs producing the same MD5 hash. This breaks integrity verification and certificate security. SHA-1 is also broken (Google\'s SHAttered attack). Use SHA-256 or SHA-3 for security-critical applications.</p></div>',

In SDE placement interviews, you are expected to go beyond surface-level definitions and understand <b>how</b> algorithms like Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and AES actually work — including the math. At firms like DE Shaw, secure communication protects trading strategies and client data; understanding TLS internals, certificate chains, and common crypto pitfalls is a practical requirement. This topic gives you the depth needed to confidently answer questions about key exchange, encryption, and PKI.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</div><p class="learn-p">The <b>Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocol</b> allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel without prior shared knowledge. It was published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Mathematical Basis:</b> DH relies on the <b>discrete logarithm problem</b> — given g, p, and g^a mod p, it is computationally infeasible to find a (for large primes).</p><div class="learn-code">Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange — Step by Step:\n\n1. Alice and Bob publicly agree on:\n   - A large prime p (e.g., p = 23)\n   - A generator g (e.g., g = 5)\n\n2. Alice picks a secret integer a (e.g., a = 6)\n   Computes A = g^a mod p = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\n   Sends A = 8 to Bob\n\n3. Bob picks a secret integer b (e.g., b = 15)\n   Computes B = g^b mod p = 5^15 mod 23 = 19\n   Sends B = 19 to Alice\n\n4. Alice computes shared secret: s = B^a mod p = 19^6 mod 23 = 2\n   Bob computes shared secret:   s = A^b mod p = 8^15 mod 23 = 2\n\nBoth get s = 2! This is the shared secret key.\nAn eavesdropper knows g=5, p=23, A=8, B=19 but cannot find s\nwithout solving the discrete log problem.</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Security:</b> The security of DH depends on the <b>discrete logarithm problem (DLP)</b>. Given g^a mod p, finding a requires trying an exponential number of possibilities for large primes (2048+ bits in practice).</p><div class="learn-warn"><b>MITM Vulnerability:</b> Basic DH is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker (Mallory) can intercept and replace A and B with her own values, establishing separate shared secrets with Alice and Bob. <b>Solution:</b> Authenticate the exchange using digital signatures or certificates (as done in TLS).</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">RSA Algorithm</div><p class="learn-p"><b>RSA</b> (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, 1977) is the most widely known asymmetric encryption algorithm.

RSA may only be used for signing the certificate.</li><li><b>Forgetting forward secrecy:</b> Static RSA key exchange means if the server key is compromised, all past recorded sessions can be decrypted. ECDHE provides forward secrecy (ephemeral keys).</li><li><b>Confusing authentication and encryption:</b> Encryption hides data; authentication proves identity. A digital signature provides authentication + integrity + non-repudiation, NOT confidentiality.</li><li><b>Saying "HTTPS is slow":</b> With TLS 1.3 (1-RTT), HTTP/2 multiplexing, and hardware AES-NI acceleration, the overhead is negligible. Session resumption with 0-RTT makes it even faster.</li><li><b>Not knowing key counts:</b> For n parties, symmetric encryption needs n(n-1)/2 keys; asymmetric needs 2n keys (one pair each).</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: Walk through the Diffie-Hellman key exchange with a numerical example.</b><br>A: Both parties agree on a prime p=23 and generator g=5. Alice picks secret a=6, computes A=5^6 mod 23=8, sends A. Bob picks secret b=15, computes B=5^15 mod 23=19, sends B. Alice computes s=19^6 mod 23=2. Bob computes s=8^15 mod 23=2. Both get shared secret 2. An eavesdropper sees g, p, A, B but cannot compute s without solving the discrete logarithm problem.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Explain RSA key generation and why it works.</b><br>A: Choose primes p, q. Compute n=pq, phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1). Pick e coprime to phi(n). Compute d=e^-1 mod phi(n). Public key (e,n), private key (d,n). Encrypt: C=M^e mod n. Decrypt: M=C^d mod n. Works because of Euler\'s theorem: M^(ed) = M^(1+k*phi(n)) = M * (M^phi(n))^k = M*1^k = M (mod n).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Describe the four AES round operations and their purpose.</b><br>A: SubBytes provides confusion via S-box substitution (non-linear). ShiftRows cyclically shifts rows for inter-column diffusion. MixColumns multiplies each column by a polynomial for intra-column diffusion. AddRoundKey XORs state with the round key. The final round skips MixColumns. Together, these achieve Shannon\'s confusion and diffusion principles.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Why is ECB mode insecure and what should you use instead?</b><br>A: ECB encrypts each block independently — identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext, revealing patterns. The ECB penguin demonstrates this: an encrypted image retains the original outline. Use GCM (best — provides authenticated encryption), CTR (parallelizable), or CBC (sequential but well-understood).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What are the key differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3?</b><br>A: TLS 1.3 reduces the handshake from 2-RTT to 1-RTT by sending key shares in ClientHello. It removes insecure algorithms (RSA key exchange, CBC ciphers, MD5, SHA-1, RC4, 3DES). Forward secrecy is mandatory (ECDHE only). Only AEAD ciphers (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305) are allowed. 0-RTT resumption is supported but has replay risks.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does certificate pinning work and when would you use it?</b><br>A: Certificate pinning hardcodes the expected certificate\'s public key hash in the application. During TLS, the app checks if the server\'s certificate matches the pin. Even if a rogue CA issues a valid certificate for the domain, it will be rejected because the public key hash won\'t match. Used in mobile banking apps and high-security systems. Downside: certificate rotation requires app updates.</p></div>',

SSE: server pushes over HTTP, unidirectional, auto-reconnect. WebSockets: bidirectional on single TCP, minimal framing (2-byte header), HTTP Upgrade handshake. WebSockets best for real-time bidirectional apps.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: POP3 vs IMAP?</b><br>A: POP3 (port 110): downloads and deletes from server, simple, poor for multi-device. IMAP (port 143): keeps on server, supports folders/flags, better for multi-device. Most modern clients use IMAP.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How does WebSocket handshake work?</b><br>A: Client sends HTTP GET with Upgrade: websocket, Connection: Upgrade, Sec-WebSocket-Key. Server responds 101 Switching Protocols with Sec-WebSocket-Accept (SHA-1 hash of key + magic GUID). Connection upgrades to WebSocket protocol.</p></div>',

Symmetric (AES): fast but needs shared key. TLS uses asymmetric for handshake (key exchange + auth), symmetric for bulk data. Best of both worlds.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Stateful firewall vs WAF?</b><br>A: Stateful firewall (L3/L4): tracks TCP states, filters by IP/port/connection state. WAF (L7): inspects HTTP content, blocks SQL injection, XSS, app-specific attacks. WAF understands HTTP semantics.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why is MD5 broken?</b><br>A: Practical collision attacks exist — two different inputs producing same hash. Breaks digital signatures and certificate verification. Use SHA-256. For passwords, use bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2 (salting + intentional slowness).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does certificate chain verification work?</b><br>A: Browser: (1) checks domain matches cert, (2) not expired, (3) verifies signature using intermediate CA\'s public key, (4) verifies intermediate via Root CA, (5) confirms Root CA is in trusted store.

No single measure is sufficient — combine network security (firewalls, IDS), transport security (TLS), application security (input validation, CSP), and operational security (monitoring, incident response).</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: How does SYN flood work and how do SYN cookies help?</b><br>A: Attacker sends thousands of SYNs with spoofed IPs. Server allocates state for each half-open connection, filling SYN queue, blocking legitimate connections. SYN cookies: server encodes connection info in the ISN of SYN-ACK. No state allocated until ACK returns. No state = no queue exhaustion.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How does ARP spoofing enable MITM?</b><br>A: Attacker sends fake ARP replies: "Gateway IP is at MY MAC." Victim\'s ARP cache is poisoned, all gateway traffic goes through attacker. Attacker forwards to real gateway (transparent proxy), reading/modifying unencrypted data. Mitigations: HTTPS, Dynamic ARP Inspection, VPN.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Stored XSS vs reflected XSS?</b><br>A: Stored: malicious script saved in DB (e.g., forum comment), served to all viewers — broad impact. Reflected: script in URL parameter echoed in response — requires victim to click crafted link. Mitigations: output encoding, Content-Security-Policy, HttpOnly cookies.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How does DNSSEC prevent cache poisoning?</b><br>A: DNSSEC cryptographically signs DNS records. Each response includes an RRSIG signature verified using the zone\'s DNSKEY, authenticated via chain of trust to the root. Forged responses lack valid signatures and are rejected.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is DNS amplification?</b><br>A: Small DNS queries (~60 bytes) sent to open resolvers with victim\'s spoofed IP. Resolvers send large responses (3000+ bytes) to victim. Amplification 50-70x. Effective because: UDP allows IP spoofing, resolvers respond to anyone, "ANY" queries generate huge responses.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why is defense-in-depth important?</b><br>A: No single measure is sufficient. Layer: network (firewalls, IDS), transport (TLS), application (validation, CSP, parameterized queries), data (encryption at rest), operational (monitoring, patching). If one layer fails, others still protect.</p></div>',

Before writing a single line of SQL, you need a blueprint that captures entities like <b>Instruments</b>, <b>Traders</b>, <b>Orders</b>, and <b>Portfolios</b> along with their relationships and constraints. The Entity-Relationship model is exactly that blueprint &mdash; it lets you reason about data at a conceptual level before committing to a physical schema. Getting the ER model wrong leads to painful schema migrations, data anomalies, and integrity issues that can cascade through every service that touches the database. In interviews, ER modeling questions test whether you can think structurally about data before diving into implementation.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Introduction to ER Model</div><p class="learn-p">The <b>Entity-Relationship (ER) Model</b> is a high-level conceptual data model used to describe the structure of a database. It was proposed by <b>Peter Chen</b> in 1976 and provides a graphical way to represent the logical structure of a database. The ER model is crucial in the <b>database design phase</b> — it acts as a blueprint before the actual relational schema is created.</p><p class="learn-p">The ER model consists of three main components:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>Entities</b> — Real-world objects or concepts (e.g., Student, Course, Employee)</li><li><b>Attributes</b> — Properties of entities (e.g., name, age, salary)</li><li><b>Relationships</b> — Associations between entities (e.g., Student <i>enrolls in</i> Course)</li></ol></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Entities and Entity Sets</div><p class="learn-p">An <b>entity</b> is a distinguishable real-world object. An <b>entity set</b> is a collection of similar entities. For example, all students in a university form the <code>Student</code> entity set.</p><p class="learn-p">Entities can be classified as:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Strong Entity</b> — Has a primary key and can exist independently. Represented by a <b>rectangle</b> in ER diagrams. Example: <code>Student</code>, <code>Employee</code>.</li><li><b>Weak Entity</b> — Cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes alone; depends on a <b>strong (owner) entity</b>. Represented by a <b>double rectangle</b>. Example: <code>Dependent</code> of an Employee. It uses a <b>partial key (discriminator)</b> combined with the owner\'s primary key.</li></ul><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> In ER diagrams, a weak entity is always connected to its owner entity via a <b>double diamond</b> (identifying relationship). The partial key is shown with a <b>dashed underline</b>.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Attributes</div><p class="learn-p">Attributes describe properties of entities. They are represented by <b>ovals</b> connected to their entity rectangle.</p><table class="learn-table"><tr><th>Attribute Type</th><th>Description</th><th>ER Symbol</th></tr><tr><td>Simple</td><td>Atomic, cannot be divided further (e.g., Age)</td><td>Simple oval</td></tr><tr><td>Composite</td><td>Can be divided into sub-parts (e.g., Name = First + Last)</td><td>Oval with sub-ovals</td></tr><tr><td>Derived</td><td>Computed from other attributes (e.g., Age from DOB)</td><td>Dashed oval</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-valued</td><td>Can have multiple values (e.g., Phone numbers)</td><td>Double oval</td></tr><tr><td>Key Attribute</td><td>Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., Student_ID)</td><td>Underlined oval</td></tr></table></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Relationships and Cardinality</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>relationship</b> is an association between two or more entities. Represented by a <b>diamond</b> in ER diagrams.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Cardinality constraints</b> specify the number of entities that can participate in a relationship:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>1:1 (One-to-One)</b> — Each entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B and vice versa. Example: Each department has exactly one manager.</li><li><b>1:N (One-to-Many)</b> — Each entity in A can be associated with many entities in B, but each entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A. Example: One department has many employees.</li><li><b>M:N (Many-to-Many)</b> — Each entity in A can be associated with many in B and vice versa. Example: Students and Courses.</li></ul><p class="learn-p"><b>Participation constraints</b>:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Total participation</b> (double line) — Every entity must participate in the relationship.</li><li><b>Partial participation</b> (single line) — Some entities may not participate.</li></ul><div class="learn-warn"><b>Warning:</b> A common interview mistake is confusing cardinality with participation. Cardinality = how many; Participation = must it participate at all?</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Converting ER Diagrams to Relational Schema</div><p class="learn-p">The ER-to-Relational mapping follows these rules:</p><ol class="learn-list"><li><b>Strong entity</b> → Table with all simple attributes. Composite attributes are flattened. Multi-valued attributes get a separate table.</li><li><b>Weak entity</b> → Table with its attributes + the primary key of the owner entity as a foreign key. Primary key = owner PK + partial key.</li><li><b>1:1 relationship</b> → Add the PK of one entity as FK in the other (preferably the one with total participation).</li><li><b>1:N relationship</b> → Add the PK of the "1" side as FK in the "N" side table.</li><li><b>M:N relationship</b> → Create a new <b>junction table</b> with PKs of both entities as a composite PK.</li></ol><div class="learn-code">-- Example: M:N relationship between Student and Course\nCREATE TABLE Enrollment (\n    student_id INT,\n    course_id  INT,\n    grade      CHAR(2),\n    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course(course_id)\n);</div><div class="learn-tip"><b>Tip:</b> In interviews, always clarify cardinality and participation constraints before converting ER to schema. This is a frequently tested skill at DE Shaw.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Extended ER (EER) Model</div><p class="learn-p">The EER model extends the basic ER model with:</p><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Generalization</b> — Bottom-up: combining similar entity types into a higher-level entity (e.g., Car + Truck → Vehicle).</li><li><b>Specialization</b> — Top-down: dividing a higher-level entity into sub-entities (e.g., Employee → Manager, Engineer).</li><li><b>Aggregation</b> — Treating a relationship as an entity for participating in another relationship.</li></ul><p class="learn-p">Specialization can be <b>disjoint (d)</b> or <b>overlapping (o)</b>, and <b>total</b> or <b>partial</b>.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Pitfalls &amp; Edge Cases</div><ul class="learn-list"><li><b>Fan Trap</b> &mdash; Occurs when two or more 1:N relationships fan out from the same entity, making it ambiguous which path to follow for certain queries. Solution: restructure the relationships or add a direct relationship.</li><li><b>Chasm Trap</b> &mdash; Occurs when a path between entities exists in the model but some instances have no connecting data (due to partial participation), leading to lost rows in queries. Solution: ensure total participation or use outer joins.</li><li><b>Overusing weak entities</b> &mdash; Not every dependent table is a weak entity. A weak entity must lack its own unique identifier. If a table has a natural unique key, it is a strong entity even if it has a foreign key dependency.</li><li><b>Confusing multi-valued attributes with 1:N relationships</b> &mdash; A phone number list for a person is a multi-valued attribute. But if each phone also has its own attributes (carrier, type, activation date), it should be modeled as a separate entity with a 1:N relationship.</li><li><b>Ternary vs. three binary relationships</b> &mdash; A ternary relationship among three entities is NOT always decomposable into three binary relationships. The semantics can differ; carefully verify the constraint before splitting.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: What is the difference between a weak and strong entity?</b><br>A: A strong entity has its own primary key and exists independently. A weak entity depends on an owner entity and uses a partial key (discriminator) combined with the owner\'s PK to be uniquely identified. In ER diagrams, weak entities use double rectangles and identifying relationships use double diamonds.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How do you convert a ternary M:N:P relationship into tables?</b><br>A: Create a junction table containing the primary keys of all three participating entities as foreign keys. The composite of all three forms the primary key of the junction table, unless functional dependencies allow a smaller key.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: When should you use aggregation in ER modeling?</b><br>A: Use aggregation when you need a relationship to participate in another relationship. For example, if Employee "works on" Project, and that work assignment is "monitored by" a Manager, you aggregate the works-on relationship into an entity and connect it to Manager.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is the difference between generalization and specialization?</b><br>A: Generalization is bottom-up: you combine multiple lower-level entity types into a single higher-level entity (e.g., Car + Truck &rarr; Vehicle). Specialization is top-down: you divide a higher-level entity into sub-entities based on distinguishing features (e.g., Employee &rarr; Manager, Engineer). Both result in the same IS-A hierarchy.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How do you handle multi-valued attributes during ER-to-relational mapping?</b><br>A: Create a separate table for the multi-valued attribute containing the primary key of the owning entity as a foreign key plus the attribute value. The composite of both columns becomes the primary key. For example, Employee phone numbers become a table (emp_id, phone_number) with PK (emp_id, phone_number).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Explain total vs. partial participation with a real example.</b><br>A: In a university database, every Course must be offered by a Department (total participation of Course in the "offers" relationship &mdash; shown by a double line). However, not every Professor may be advising a student (partial participation of Professor in the "advises" relationship &mdash; shown by a single line).</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How do you decide whether to place the FK in a 1:1 relationship?</b><br>A: Place the FK on the side with total participation. If both sides have total participation, either side works. If both have partial participation, consider which side is queried more often, or merge the tables if the entities are tightly coupled.</p></div>',

Start with that set, compute its closure. If the closure covers all attributes, that set is a candidate key. If not, try adding one attribute at a time and recompute. A candidate key is minimal: no proper subset should also be a superkey.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: What is the difference between RESTRICT and NO ACTION for foreign keys?</b><br>A: Both prevent deletion/update of a referenced row if referencing rows exist. The difference is timing: RESTRICT checks immediately when the statement is executed, while NO ACTION defers the check until the end of the statement (or transaction in some RDBMS). This matters when triggers or other constraints might resolve the conflict before the check.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Can a foreign key reference a UNIQUE column that is not the primary key?</b><br>A: Yes. In SQL, a foreign key can reference any column (or set of columns) with a UNIQUE constraint, not just the primary key. However, best practice is to reference the primary key for clarity.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What are Armstrong\'s axioms and why are they important?</b><br>A: Armstrong\'s axioms are three inference rules &mdash; Reflexivity, Augmentation, and Transitivity &mdash; that are <b>sound</b> (they only derive correct FDs) and <b>complete</b> (they can derive all FDs that logically follow from a given set). They are the foundation for computing attribute closures, finding candidate keys, and computing minimal covers for normalization.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Explain the difference between a superkey and a candidate key with an example.</b><br>A: In a Student table with attributes {student_id, email, name, age}, both {student_id} and {student_id, name} are superkeys (they uniquely identify rows). But only {student_id} is a candidate key because it is minimal &mdash; removing any attribute would lose uniqueness. {student_id, name} is a superkey but not a candidate key because the subset {student_id} is already sufficient.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: When would you use ON DELETE SET NULL vs. ON DELETE CASCADE?</b><br>A: Use CASCADE when the child rows have no meaning without the parent (e.g., order line items when the order is deleted). Use SET NULL when the child rows should survive but lose the association (e.g., employees whose department is dissolved &mdash; they still exist but become unassigned). The choice depends on business semantics.</p></div>',

    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- 2. Composite Primary Key example
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id  INT,
    course_id   INT,
    semester    VARCHAR(10),
    grade       CHAR(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id, semester),  -- Composite Key
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id),

-- 5. Finding candidate keys: worked example
-- Relation R(A, B, C, D, E)
-- FDs: A -> BC, CD -> E, B -> D, E -> A
-- Step 1: Attributes only on LHS or neither: none exclusively
-- Step 2: Try {A}: A+ = {A,B,C,D,E} = R => {A} is candidate key
-- Step 3: Try {E}: E+ = {E,A,B,C,D} = R => {E} is candidate key
-- Step 4: Try {B}: B+ = {B,D} ≠ R
-- Step 5: Try {C}: C+ = {C} ≠ R
-- Step 6: Try {BC}: BC+ = {B,C,D,E,A} = R => {BC} is candidate key
-- Candidate keys: {A}, {E}, {BC}

R ⋈ S = π_{unique attrs}(σ_{R.common = S.common}(R × S)). That is: take the Cartesian product, select rows where common attributes match, and project out the duplicate columns. This is why natural join is a derived operation, not primitive.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is the difference between Cartesian product and cross join?</b><br>A: They are identical. In relational algebra it is called the Cartesian product (×); in SQL it is called CROSS JOIN.

Solving this cleanly requires mastery of SELECT, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY working together.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Introduction to SQL</div><p class="learn-p"><b>SQL (Structured Query Language)</b> is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.

However, MySQL allows aliases in GROUP BY and HAVING as a non-standard extension.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?</b><br>A: DELETE is DML (row-by-row, can use WHERE, can rollback, fires triggers). TRUNCATE is DDL (removes all rows, resets auto-increment, generally cannot rollback, does not fire row-level triggers). DROP removes the table structure and data entirely.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?</b><br>A: WHERE filters individual rows before grouping. HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY. HAVING can use aggregate functions (e.g., HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5); WHERE cannot. If you can filter with WHERE, prefer it &mdash; it reduces the data before grouping, improving performance.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What does COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column) vs COUNT(DISTINCT column) return?</b><br>A: COUNT(*) counts all rows including NULLs. COUNT(column) counts non-NULL values in that column. COUNT(DISTINCT column) counts unique non-NULL values. For example, if a column has values [1, 2, NULL, 2], COUNT(*) = 4, COUNT(col) = 3, COUNT(DISTINCT col) = 2.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why should you never use = NULL instead of IS NULL?</b><br>A: In SQL, NULL represents an unknown value. Any comparison with NULL using = yields NULL (not TRUE or FALSE), because you cannot know if an unknown equals something. IS NULL is a special operator designed for this check. Similarly, NULL = NULL is NULL, not TRUE.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Can you use a column alias in WHERE? In ORDER BY?</b><br>A: No for WHERE (it executes before SELECT where aliases are defined). Yes for ORDER BY (it executes after SELECT). GROUP BY behavior varies: MySQL allows aliases, standard SQL does not.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What happens if you SELECT a non-aggregated column without including it in GROUP BY?</b><br>A: In standard SQL, this is an error. MySQL with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY disabled allows it but returns an arbitrary value from the group, which is unpredictable and error-prone. Always include all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY.</p></div>',

Good when data is already sorted or indexes exist.</li></ul></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?</b><br>A: INNER JOIN returns only rows with matching keys in both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table; if no match exists in the right table, right-side columns are filled with NULL. Use LEFT JOIN when you need to preserve all rows from one table regardless of matches.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How do you find rows in table A that have no corresponding row in table B?</b><br>A: Use an anti-join pattern: <code>SELECT a.* FROM A a LEFT JOIN B b ON a.id = b.a_id WHERE b.a_id IS NULL</code>. Alternatively, use <code>NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM B WHERE B.a_id = A.id)</code>. Both are efficient; NOT EXISTS may perform better with proper indexing.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Can NULL join keys match in a JOIN?</b><br>A: No. Since NULL = NULL evaluates to NULL (not TRUE), rows with NULL join keys never match in any join type. In a LEFT JOIN, such rows from the left table appear in the result with NULLs for right-side columns, but they do not match any right-side row.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: If table A has 1000 rows and table B has 500 rows, what is the maximum number of rows from an INNER JOIN?</b><br>A: It depends on the join keys. If the join is on a non-unique key, the maximum is 1000 &times; 500 = 500,000 (every row matches every other). If both keys are unique (1:1), the maximum is 500 (limited by the smaller table). Understanding cardinality is crucial for predicting result sizes.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is a self join? Give a real-world example.</b><br>A: A self join joins a table with itself using different aliases. Classic example: finding employees who earn more than their manager. <code>SELECT e.name FROM Employees e JOIN Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id WHERE e.salary &gt; m.salary</code>. Also used for finding pairs, hierarchies, and sequential comparisons.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Why should you avoid NATURAL JOIN in production code?</b><br>A: NATURAL JOIN automatically joins on all columns with matching names. If someone later adds a column with the same name to both tables, the join condition silently changes, potentially producing incorrect results. Always use explicit ON or USING clauses.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How does the database engine choose between Nested Loop, Hash Join, and Sort-Merge Join?</b><br>A: The query optimizer considers table sizes, available indexes, and memory. Nested Loop is preferred when one table is small or an index exists on the join key. Hash Join is best for large unsorted tables with equi-joins. Sort-Merge is efficient when both inputs are already sorted or can leverage existing indexes.</p></div>',

At DE Shaw, analysts use subqueries to find outlier trades (transactions deviating from portfolio averages), detect duplicate records across data feeds, and build derived metrics for risk dashboards. Interview questions frequently require subqueries: "Find employees who earn more than the average of their department," "Find the second highest salary," or "Find departments with no active employees." Understanding when to use correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries, and when to prefer EXISTS over IN, separates competent SQL users from experts.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">What are Subqueries?</div><p class="learn-p">A <b>subquery</b> (also called a <b>nested query</b> or <b>inner query</b>) is a query embedded within another SQL query.

A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and executes once per row of the outer query, making it potentially O(n &times; m) in cost. Example of correlated: finding employees earning above their department average.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why does NOT IN fail with NULLs, and what should you use instead?</b><br>A: If the subquery returns any NULL value, <code>NOT IN</code> returns no rows because <code>x NOT IN (1, NULL)</code> evaluates to UNKNOWN for any x (since x &lt;&gt; NULL is UNKNOWN). Use <code>NOT EXISTS</code> instead, which correctly handles NULLs by testing for row existence rather than value comparison.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: How would you find the Nth highest salary?</b><br>A: Three approaches: (1) <code>SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1</code>; (2) Correlated subquery: <code>WHERE (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e2.salary &gt; e1.salary) = N-1</code>; (3) Using DENSE_RANK() window function and filtering where rank = N. The window function approach is cleanest and handles ties properly.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: When should you use EXISTS vs IN?</b><br>A: EXISTS is generally preferred for correlated checks because it short-circuits (stops scanning once a match is found). IN is fine for small static lists or non-correlated subqueries returning few rows. EXISTS handles NULLs correctly while IN does not with NOT IN. Modern optimizers often transform one into the other, but understanding the semantic difference matters in interviews.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is a derived table and when would you use one?</b><br>A: A derived table is a subquery in the FROM clause that acts as a temporary, unnamed table. It must have an alias. Use it when you need to aggregate aggregates (e.g., average of department averages), apply filtering on computed columns, or create intermediate result sets. Example: <code>SELECT AVG(dept_avg) FROM (SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS dept_avg FROM Emp GROUP BY dept_id) t</code>.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: Can you rewrite a correlated subquery as a JOIN? Why would you?</b><br>A: Yes, most correlated subqueries can be rewritten as JOINs. The JOIN version is often more efficient because the optimizer can choose a Hash or Sort-Merge join algorithm, whereas correlated subqueries may force a Nested Loop execution. Example: <code>WHERE salary &gt; (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Emp e2 WHERE e2.dept = e1.dept)</code> can become a JOIN with a pre-computed department average table.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is the difference between ANY and ALL operators?</b><br>A: <code>&gt; ANY (subquery)</code> returns TRUE if the value is greater than at least one value in the subquery result (equivalent to &gt; MIN). <code>&gt; ALL (subquery)</code> returns TRUE only if the value is greater than every value in the result (equivalent to &gt; MAX). If the subquery returns an empty set, ALL returns TRUE and ANY returns FALSE.</p></div>',

RANK assigns 1,1,3,4 &mdash; ties get the same rank, then it skips. DENSE_RANK assigns 1,1,2,3 &mdash; ties get the same rank with no gaps. Use ROW_NUMBER when you need exactly N rows per group (top-N); use DENSE_RANK when you need the Nth distinct value.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How do you find the top N earners per department?</b><br>A: Use a subquery with ROW_NUMBER: <code>SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn FROM Employees) t WHERE rn &lt;= N</code>. Note: you cannot put WHERE rn &lt;= N in the same SELECT as the window function because window functions execute after WHERE.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Why does LAST_VALUE often return the current row\'s value instead of the actual last value?</b><br>A: The default window frame when ORDER BY is specified is <code>RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</code>. So LAST_VALUE only sees up to the current row, returning the current row\'s value. To get the true last value, explicitly set the frame: <code>ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</code>.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Can you use a window function in a WHERE clause?</b><br>A: No. Window functions are evaluated after WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING in the logical execution order. To filter based on a window function result, wrap the query in a subquery or CTE and filter in the outer query\'s WHERE clause.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: How do you compute a running total?</b><br>A: Use <code>SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date_col ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)</code>. The ORDER BY within OVER establishes the running order, and the default frame (with ORDER BY) is cumulative from the start to the current row.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is the difference between ROWS and RANGE in a frame clause?</b><br>A: ROWS counts physical row positions (e.g., 2 PRECEDING means literally 2 rows before). RANGE considers logical value ranges (e.g., RANGE 2 PRECEDING includes all rows whose ORDER BY value is within 2 of the current row\'s value). For most practical purposes, ROWS is more predictable and commonly used.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: How do you detect consecutive sequences using window functions?</b><br>A: Assign ROW_NUMBER() and subtract it from the value column. Consecutive values produce the same difference (group identifier). For example, for values 1,2,3,7,8: subtracting ROW_NUMBER gives 0,0,0,3,3 &mdash; the constant value identifies each consecutive group.</p></div>',

A materialized view physically stores the result set and must be explicitly refreshed. Regular views are always up-to-date but can be slow for complex queries. Materialized views are fast to read but may serve stale data between refreshes.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Can you INSERT into a view? Under what conditions?</b><br>A: Yes, if the view is updatable: it must map to a single base table, contain no aggregations, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, UNION, or subqueries, and all NOT NULL columns (without defaults) of the base table must be included. WITH CHECK OPTION prevents inserting rows that would not satisfy the view\'s WHERE clause.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Explain the leftmost prefix rule for composite indexes.</b><br>A: For a composite index on (A, B, C), the index can be used for queries filtering on A, (A, B), or (A, B, C) &mdash; always starting from the leftmost column. A query filtering only on B or C cannot use this index efficiently. This is because B-tree indexes are organized hierarchically from left to right.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?</b><br>A: A clustered index determines the physical storage order of data rows &mdash; a table can have only one. In InnoDB (MySQL), the primary key is the clustered index. A non-clustered index is a separate B-tree structure that contains pointers (row IDs or primary key values) back to the actual data. Looking up data via a non-clustered index may require a second lookup (bookmark lookup) to fetch the full row.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: When should you NOT create an index?</b><br>A: Avoid indexes on: (1) small tables where a full scan is faster than index overhead; (2) columns with very low cardinality (e.g., boolean or gender); (3) tables with heavy INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE workloads since each write must update all indexes; (4) columns rarely used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is the difference between a stored procedure and a stored function?</b><br>A: A stored procedure can perform actions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), return multiple result sets, and use IN/OUT/INOUT parameters. It is called with CALL. A stored function must return exactly one value, can be used inside SQL expressions (e.g., in SELECT), and generally cannot modify data. Functions must be deterministic if used in replication.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What are the risks of using triggers?</b><br>A: Triggers can cause: (1) cascading effects that are hard to debug (trigger A fires trigger B); (2) hidden business logic that developers may not know exists; (3) performance overhead on every affected DML statement; (4) difficulty in testing and replication. They should be used sparingly and well-documented.</p></div>',

Practice converting nested subqueries to CTEs for readability, and use conditional aggregation for pivot-style queries.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: What is a CTE and how does it differ from a subquery?</b><br>A: A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a named temporary result set defined with the WITH clause. Unlike subqueries, CTEs can be referenced multiple times in the main query, improving readability and avoiding code duplication. CTEs can also be recursive. However, most databases treat non-recursive CTEs as inline expansions (similar to subqueries), so performance is usually equivalent.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How does a recursive CTE work?</b><br>A: A recursive CTE has two parts joined by UNION ALL: (1) the anchor member (base case) that provides the initial rows, and (2) the recursive member that references the CTE itself and adds rows iteratively. Execution stops when the recursive member returns no new rows. Classic use cases include org chart traversal, tree flattening, and generating number series.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?</b><br>A: UNION removes duplicate rows from the combined result (requiring a sort or hash for deduplication). UNION ALL keeps all rows including duplicates and is faster because it skips deduplication. Always use UNION ALL when you know there are no duplicates or when duplicates are acceptable.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How do you pivot rows into columns without a PIVOT keyword?</b><br>A: Use conditional aggregation with CASE: <code>SELECT dept, SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2023 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS rev_2023, SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2024 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS rev_2024 FROM sales GROUP BY dept</code>. Each CASE expression creates one output column by selectively summing values that match the condition.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What does COALESCE do and how does it differ from IFNULL?</b><br>A: COALESCE(a, b, c, ...) returns the first non-NULL argument from any number of inputs. It is standard SQL. IFNULL(a, b) is MySQL-specific and only takes two arguments. COALESCE is preferred for portability and flexibility. Common use: providing default values for nullable columns.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What does NULLIF do and when is it useful?</b><br>A: NULLIF(a, b) returns NULL if a equals b, otherwise returns a. Its most common use is preventing division by zero: <code>revenue / NULLIF(units, 0)</code> returns NULL instead of raising an error when units is 0. Without NULLIF, you would need a CASE expression.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: Can CTEs reference each other?</b><br>A: Yes. In a WITH clause with multiple CTEs, each subsequent CTE can reference any previously defined CTE. For example: <code>WITH cte1 AS (...), cte2 AS (SELECT ... FROM cte1 ...) SELECT ... FROM cte2</code>. This allows building complex queries step by step for readability.</p></div>',

The only candidate key is {student_id, course_id}. For 2NF, remove partial dependencies: extract Student(student_id, student_name) and Course(course_id, course_name, instructor). For 3NF/BCNF, check each remaining relation — every determinant in Student and Course is already a superkey of its respective table, so the decomposition is in BCNF. Enrollment(student_id, course_id, grade) has {student_id, course_id} as its only FD determinant, which is its superkey.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Can BCNF decomposition lose dependencies?</b><br>A: Yes. BCNF decomposition always guarantees lossless-join but may <b>not</b> preserve all functional dependencies. The classic example is Teaching(student, subject, teacher) with FDs {student, subject} → teacher and teacher → subject. BCNF decomposition into TeacherSubject(teacher, subject) and StudentTeacher(student, teacher) loses the FD {student, subject} → teacher because you cannot check it without joining the two tables.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: When is 3NF preferred over BCNF?</b><br>A: When dependency preservation is critical. The 3NF synthesis algorithm guarantees both lossless-join and dependency preservation. If your application must enforce all FDs at the single-table level without expensive joins, 3NF may be the better choice even though it allows some controlled redundancy where a prime attribute is determined by a non-superkey.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How do you find candidate keys from a set of functional dependencies?</b><br>A: (1) Find attributes that appear <b>only on the left side</b> of FDs — they must be part of every candidate key. (2) Find attributes that appear <b>only on the right side</b> — they can never be part of any candidate key. (3) Start with the must-have attributes, compute their closure. If the closure covers all attributes, that set is a candidate key. If not, try adding attributes that appear on both sides, one at a time, and check closures until you find all minimal superkeys.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is the difference between lossless-join and dependency-preserving decomposition?</b><br>A: Lossless-join means that natural-joining the decomposed relations yields exactly the original relation with no spurious tuples. You verify it by checking that the common attributes of any two decomposed tables form a superkey of at least one of them. Dependency-preserving means the union of FDs enforceable on individual decomposed tables is equivalent to the original set of FDs — every FD can be checked without performing a join. A decomposition can be lossless but not dependency-preserving, and vice versa.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is a multivalued dependency, and how does 4NF address it?</b><br>A: A multivalued dependency (MVD) X →→ Y means that for a given X value, the set of Y values is independent of the other attributes in the relation. Even a BCNF relation can have redundancy due to MVDs. 4NF requires that for every non-trivial MVD X →→ Y, X must be a superkey. Decomposing based on MVDs eliminates this redundancy.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: Given FDs {A → B, B → C, C → D, D → A}, what are the candidate keys of R(A, B, C, D)?</b><br>A: Compute closures: A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}, B⁺ = {B, C, D, A}, C⁺ = {C, D, A, B}, D⁺ = {D, A, B, C}. Every single attribute determines all attributes, so A, B, C, and D are each candidate keys individually.</p></div>',

The three main pitfalls: <b>stale data</b> (TTL too long), <b>thundering herd</b> (many requests hit DB when cache expires simultaneously), and <b>cache penetration</b> (querying keys that never exist, bypassing cache every time).</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: When would you choose to denormalize a database?</b><br>A: I would denormalize only after first normalizing to at least 3NF/BCNF and then identifying specific performance bottlenecks through profiling and query analysis. Common triggers include: read-heavy workloads where the same multi-table JOINs run thousands of times per second, real-time dashboards requiring sub-100ms responses, distributed databases where cross-partition JOINs are prohibitively expensive, and reporting/analytics queries that need precomputed aggregates. The key is to denormalize surgically — only the specific tables and columns causing bottlenecks — not the entire schema.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How do you maintain data consistency in a denormalized schema?</b><br>A: Four common strategies: (1) <b>Database triggers</b> that automatically propagate changes to redundant columns. (2) <b>Application-level logic</b> that updates all copies within a single transaction. (3) <b>Batch/ETL jobs</b> that periodically refresh denormalized tables — acceptable when near-real-time consistency suffices. (4) <b>Change Data Capture (CDC)</b> or event sourcing, where changes are published as events and consumers update denormalized stores asynchronously. The choice depends on consistency requirements: triggers for strict consistency, CDC/batch for eventual consistency.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is the difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema?</b><br>A: Both are data warehouse designs. A <b>star schema</b> has a central fact table surrounded by denormalized dimension tables — each dimension is a single table with all its attributes. A <b>snowflake schema</b> normalizes the dimension tables into sub-dimensions. Star schemas are simpler, faster for queries (fewer JOINs), and easier for analysts to understand. Snowflake schemas reduce redundancy in dimensions but require more JOINs. In practice, star schemas are more common because query performance matters more than storage savings in analytical workloads.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: How do OLTP and OLAP database designs differ?</b><br>A: <b>OLTP</b> (Online Transaction Processing) systems are optimized for fast, frequent, small transactions — inserts, updates, deletes. They use normalized schemas (3NF/BCNF) to minimize redundancy and ensure consistency. <b>OLAP</b> (Online Analytical Processing) systems are optimized for complex analytical queries on large datasets — aggregations, reporting, trend analysis. They use denormalized schemas (star/snowflake) to minimize JOINs and maximize read throughput. Typically, data flows from OLTP to OLAP via ETL pipelines.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: A table has columns (order_id, customer_id, customer_name, product_id, product_name, quantity, price). Is this denormalized? What are the trade-offs?</b><br>A: Yes, this is denormalized. customer_name is redundant (derivable from customer_id via a Customers table), and product_name is redundant (derivable from product_id). The trade-offs: reads are faster because listing orders no longer requires JOINs to Customers and Products. But writes are slower — inserting an order requires populating redundant fields, and if a customer changes their name, all their order rows need updating. There is also a risk of inconsistency if the application fails to update all copies. However, for product_name and price, this may actually be a <b>business requirement</b> — you want the name and price at the time of purchase, not the current values.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is a materialized view, and how does it differ from a regular view?</b><br>A: A regular view is a saved query — it executes the underlying SELECT every time it is referenced, so it always reflects current data but offers no performance benefit. A materialized view <b>physically stores</b> the query result. Reads are fast (just a table scan), but the data can become stale. Materialized views must be refreshed — either on a schedule, on-demand, or incrementally when base tables change. They are ideal for expensive aggregation queries that run frequently but where slightly stale data is acceptable.</p></div>',

-- Common query requires 4-table join
SELECT c.name, o.order_date, p.product_name, oi.quantity, p.price

JOIN Customers c  ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN Products p   ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE c.customer_id = 123;

-- ===== DENORMALIZED DESIGN =====

-- Technique 1: Redundant columns
ALTER TABLE Orders ADD customer_name VARCHAR(100);
-- Now simple order listing doesn't need Customer JOIN

-- Technique 2: Snapshot data in OrderItems
ALTER TABLE OrderItems
    ADD product_name VARCHAR(200),
    ADD unit_price   DECIMAL(10,2);
-- Stores price at time of purchase (business requirement too!)

-- Technique 3: Precomputed aggregates
ALTER TABLE Customers
    ADD total_orders INT DEFAULT 0,
    ADD total_spent  DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Trigger to maintain aggregates
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER after_order_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Customers
    SET total_orders = total_orders + 1
    WHERE customer_id = NEW.customer_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Technique 4: Materialized aggregation table
CREATE TABLE DailySalesSummary (
    sale_date    DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    total_orders INT,
    total_revenue DECIMAL(12,2),
    avg_order_value DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Refresh daily via batch job
INSERT INTO DailySalesSummary
SELECT o.order_date,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id),
       SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price),
       AVG(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)

JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id

GROUP BY o.order_date
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    total_orders = VALUES(total_orders),
    total_revenue = VALUES(total_revenue),
    avg_order_value = VALUES(avg_order_value);

At REPEATABLE READ, the transaction sees a consistent snapshot from its start — re-reading the same row always returns the same value. In PostgreSQL, REPEATABLE READ uses snapshot isolation (MVCC). In MySQL InnoDB, REPEATABLE READ also uses next-key locking which prevents phantoms in practice, making it behave closer to SERIALIZABLE.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is the difference between conflict serializability and view serializability?</b><br>A: Conflict serializability is checked by building a precedence graph from conflicting operations (same data item, different transactions, at least one write) — if acyclic, the schedule is conflict-serializable. View serializability is a weaker condition: a schedule S is view-serializable if there exists a serial schedule S\' where (1) each transaction reads-from the same writer, (2) the final write on each item is by the same transaction. Every conflict-serializable schedule is view-serializable, but not vice versa. Testing view serializability is NP-complete, so conflict serializability is used in practice.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Explain the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol and its main limitation.</b><br>A: 2PC coordinates distributed transactions across multiple nodes. In Phase 1 (Prepare), the coordinator asks all participants to vote YES/NO. Each participant writes redo/undo logs and acquires locks before voting. In Phase 2 (Commit/Abort), if all vote YES, the coordinator sends COMMIT; otherwise ABORT. The main limitation is <b>blocking</b>: if the coordinator crashes after PREPARE but before Phase 2, participants are stuck holding locks indefinitely, waiting for a decision. 3PC addresses this by adding a PRE-COMMIT phase, but modern systems prefer the Saga pattern instead.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is a lost update anomaly, and how do you prevent it?</b><br>A: A lost update occurs when two transactions read the same value, compute new values based on it, and both write — the first write is overwritten and lost. For example, both T1 and T2 read balance=1000. T1 writes 1100, T2 writes 1200. T1\'s update is lost. Prevention strategies: (1) Use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE to acquire an exclusive lock before reading. (2) Use SERIALIZABLE isolation level. (3) Implement optimistic concurrency control with a version column — UPDATE ... WHERE version = expected_version, and retry if zero rows affected.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and why is it essential?</b><br>A: The WAL is a sequential log where all modifications are written <b>before</b> being applied to the actual data pages. This ensures <b>durability</b> (committed changes survive crashes) and <b>atomicity</b> (uncommitted changes can be undone). On crash recovery, the DBMS replays the WAL: redo committed transactions whose data pages were not flushed, and undo uncommitted transactions that partially modified pages. WAL is sequential I/O, which is much faster than the random I/O of updating data pages directly.</p></div>',

Why does Strict 2PL prevent cascading aborts?</b><br>A: Two-Phase Locking divides a transaction into a growing phase (only acquires locks) and a shrinking phase (only releases locks). This guarantees conflict serializability. In <b>Basic 2PL</b>, locks can be released before commit, so another transaction T2 might read data written by T1, and if T1 later aborts, T2 must also abort (cascading abort). <b>Strict 2PL</b> holds all exclusive (write) locks until commit/abort, so no other transaction can read uncommitted data — preventing cascading aborts. <b>Rigorous 2PL</b> holds all locks (shared and exclusive) until commit, which is even simpler but more restrictive.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Compare deadlock prevention and deadlock detection. Which is used in practice?</b><br>A: <b>Deadlock prevention</b> uses transaction timestamps to decide who waits and who aborts: Wait-Die (non-preemptive) lets older transactions wait for younger ones but aborts younger transactions requesting locks held by older ones; Wound-Wait (preemptive) lets older transactions abort younger ones but makes younger transactions wait. <b>Deadlock detection</b> periodically builds a wait-for graph and checks for cycles — if found, one transaction (the victim) is rolled back. In practice, most DBMS use detection (e.g., InnoDB checks for deadlocks on every lock wait). Prevention is more common in distributed systems where building a global wait-for graph is expensive.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: How does MVCC work internally in PostgreSQL or InnoDB?</b><br>A: In <b>PostgreSQL</b>, each row tuple has xmin (creating transaction ID) and xmax (deleting/updating transaction ID). An UPDATE creates a new tuple with a new xmin and marks the old tuple with xmax. A reading transaction sees tuples where xmin is committed and before its snapshot, and xmax is either empty or from a transaction not yet visible. Dead tuples are cleaned up by VACUUM. In <b>InnoDB</b>, the undo log stores previous versions. When a row is updated, the new version is written in-place and the old version is saved in the undo log. Readers follow the undo log chain to find the version visible to their snapshot.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What is Thomas\' Write Rule, and when does it apply?</b><br>A: Thomas\' Write Rule is an optimization for the basic timestamp ordering protocol. Normally, if transaction T tries to write data item Q and TS(T) &lt; W-timestamp(Q), T is rolled back because a newer transaction has already written Q. Thomas\' Write Rule instead <b>skips the write</b> without aborting — since a newer value already exists, T\'s write would be immediately overwritten anyway. This reduces unnecessary aborts. However, it only works with the write rule; if TS(T) &lt; R-timestamp(Q), T must still abort because a newer transaction has already read the old value.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What are the trade-offs of lock granularity?</b><br>A: Finer granularity (row-level locks) provides higher concurrency because different transactions can access different rows simultaneously, but it incurs higher overhead — more locks to manage, more memory, and more CPU for lock table lookups. Coarser granularity (table-level locks) has less overhead but severely limits concurrency since an entire table is locked. The solution is <b>intention locks</b>: a transaction first acquires an intention lock at a coarser level (e.g., IX on the table) before acquiring the actual lock at a finer level (e.g., X on a row). This allows the system to quickly check compatibility at the table level without examining every row lock.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) differ from pessimistic locking?</b><br>A: Pessimistic approaches (2PL, locks) assume conflicts are likely and prevent them by acquiring locks upfront — this can cause blocking and deadlocks. OCC assumes conflicts are rare and lets transactions proceed without locking. In the validation phase (before commit), the system checks whether the transaction conflicts with any concurrent transaction. If a conflict is detected, the transaction is rolled back and retried. OCC has three phases: read, validate, write. It performs better under low-contention workloads but suffers under high contention due to frequent restarts. A practical variant is <b>version-based OCC</b>, where each row has a version counter and the UPDATE includes a WHERE version = expected_version check.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: A system uses Strict 2PL and encounters frequent deadlocks. What strategies would you consider?</b><br>A: Several strategies: (1) <b>Lock ordering</b> — ensure all transactions acquire locks in the same global order (e.g., by primary key), eliminating cycles. (2) <b>Lock timeouts</b> — abort transactions that wait too long for a lock, reducing blocked time. (3) <b>Reduce lock duration</b> — minimize the work done while holding locks (avoid network calls or heavy computation inside transactions). (4) <b>Reduce lock scope</b> — use finer-grained locks (row-level vs. table-level). (5) <b>Switch to MVCC</b> — readers no longer block writers, eliminating a major source of lock contention. (6) <b>Application redesign</b> — batch operations or partition data to reduce conflicts.</p></div>',
          code: `-- =============================================
-- Concurrency Control Demonstrations
-- =============================================

-- ===== LOCK-BASED CONTROL =====

-- MySQL InnoDB uses row-level locking by default

-- Shared (read) lock
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1 LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
-- Other transactions can also read with LOCK IN SHARE MODE
-- but cannot UPDATE until this transaction commits
COMMIT;

-- Exclusive (write) lock
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
-- Exclusive lock: no other transaction can read (with lock) or write
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE acc_id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- ===== DEMONSTRATING 2PL =====

-- Strict 2PL (default in InnoDB):
-- All write locks held until COMMIT

-- Transaction T1:
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- X-lock on acc_id=1 acquired, held until COMMIT
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE acc_id = 2;
-- X-lock on acc_id=2 acquired, held until COMMIT
COMMIT;
-- Both locks released at COMMIT (Strict 2PL)

-- ===== DEADLOCK SCENARIO =====

-- Session 1:
-- START TRANSACTION;
-- UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- -- holds X-lock on acc_id=1
-- -- now tries to lock acc_id=2 (Session 2 holds it)
-- UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE acc_id = 2;

-- Session 2 (concurrent):
-- START TRANSACTION;
-- UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE acc_id = 2;
-- -- holds X-lock on acc_id=2
-- -- now tries to lock acc_id=1 (Session 1 holds it)
-- UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- -- DEADLOCK DETECTED! InnoDB rolls back one transaction.

-- Check for deadlocks:
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;  -- includes latest deadlock info

-- ===== MVCC in action (MySQL InnoDB) =====

-- Session 1 (REPEATABLE READ):
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- Reads from a consistent snapshot (e.g., balance = 10000)

-- Session 2 (commits between Session 1's reads):
-- START TRANSACTION;
-- UPDATE Accounts SET balance = 7000 WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- COMMIT;

-- Back to Session 1:
SELECT balance FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- MVCC: Still reads 10000 (from the snapshot at transaction start)
COMMIT;

-- ===== OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY CONTROL (Application-Level) =====

-- Step 1: Read with version
SELECT balance, version FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- Returns: balance=10000, version=5

-- Step 2: Application processes... then writes with version check
UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = 9000, version = version + 1
WHERE acc_id = 1 AND version = 5;
-- If ROW_COUNT() = 0, another transaction modified it => retry!

-- ===== LOCK GRANULARITY =====

-- Table-level lock (MyISAM or explicit)
LOCK TABLES Accounts WRITE;
-- ... operations ...
UNLOCK TABLES;

-- Row-level lock (InnoDB default with indexes)
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
-- Only locks the specific row (if acc_id has an index)`,

Leaf nodes are linked in a doubly linked list, enabling efficient range scans. Every lookup traverses to a leaf, providing predictable I/O cost.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?</b><br>A: A clustered index determines the physical storage order of data rows &mdash; there can be only one per table. A non-clustered index is a separate structure with pointers back to the data rows, and you can have many. In InnoDB, the primary key is the clustered index, and secondary indexes store the primary key value in their leaves, requiring an extra lookup to fetch the full row.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What is a covering index and why is it beneficial?</b><br>A: A covering index includes all columns needed by a query in the index itself. The DBMS can satisfy the query entirely from the index without accessing the base table (an index-only scan), eliminating costly random I/O to the data pages.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Explain the leftmost prefix rule for composite indexes.</b><br>A: A composite index on (A, B, C) can be used for queries filtering on A, or A and B, or A, B, and C &mdash; but not B alone or C alone. The index entries are sorted first by A, then by B within A, then by C within (A, B). Skipping the leftmost column means the sort order cannot be exploited.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: When would you NOT create an index?</b><br>A: Avoid indexes on: (1) small tables where a full scan is faster, (2) columns with very low cardinality (e.g., a boolean column), (3) write-heavy tables where index maintenance overhead outweighs read benefits, (4) columns rarely used in WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY clauses, and (5) wide indexes that consume excessive storage.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does InnoDB handle secondary indexes differently from MyISAM?</b><br>A: InnoDB secondary indexes store the primary key value in their leaf nodes, so a secondary index lookup requires two B+ Tree traversals: first the secondary index to find the primary key, then the primary key (clustered) index to fetch the row. MyISAM stores direct row pointers, requiring only one lookup but losing the data-locality benefits of clustered storage.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: What is the difference between a dense and a sparse index?</b><br>A: A dense index has an entry for every record in the data file &mdash; any record can be found directly. A sparse index has entries for only some records (e.g., one per disk block) and requires the data to be sorted on the search key. Sparse indexes are smaller but need sequential search within a block. Clustered indexes can be sparse; non-clustered indexes must be dense.</p></div>',
          code: `-- =============================================
-- B-Tree, B+ Tree & Hash Indexing
-- =============================================

-- ===== CREATING INDEXES =====

-- Default B+ Tree index (most common)
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON Employees(salary);

-- Unique index (also used for UNIQUE constraints)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON Employees(email);

-- Composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON Employees(dept_id, salary);
-- Useful for: WHERE dept_id = 10 AND salary > 50000
-- Also useful for: WHERE dept_id = 10 (leftmost prefix)
-- NOT useful for: WHERE salary > 50000 (not leftmost)

-- Covering index (includes all columns needed by query)
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON Employees(dept_id, salary, name);
-- SELECT name, salary FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10
-- This query can be answered entirely from the index (no table lookup)

-- ===== INDEX USAGE ANALYSIS =====

-- Check if a query uses an index
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 90000;
-- Look for: type=range, key=idx_salary

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10 AND salary > 50000;
-- Should use idx_dept_salary

-- Queries that CANNOT use idx_dept_salary efficiently:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 50000;
-- Full table scan or uses a different index

-- ===== HASH INDEX (Memory Engine) =====
CREATE TABLE SessionCache (
    session_id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id    INT,
    data       TEXT,
    INDEX USING HASH (session_id)
) ENGINE = MEMORY;

-- Fast exact lookup (uses hash):
SELECT * FROM SessionCache WHERE session_id = 'abc123';

-- Cannot use hash for range:
-- SELECT * FROM SessionCache WHERE session_id > 'abc';
-- This would require a full scan

-- ===== B+ TREE HEIGHT CALCULATION =====
-- Given:
--   Block size = 4096 bytes
--   Key size = 8 bytes (INT)
--   Pointer size = 8 bytes
--   Record pointer = 8 bytes
--
-- Internal node: keys and child pointers
--   p * 8 + (p-1) * 8 <= 4096
--   16p - 8 <= 4096 => p = 256 (fan-out)
--
-- Leaf node: keys and record pointers
--   n * (8 + 8) + 8 (next leaf pointer) <= 4096
--   16n <= 4088 => n = 255 records per leaf
--
-- For 1,000,000 records:
--   Leaf nodes = ceil(1000000 / 255) = 3922
--   Level 1 internal = ceil(3922 / 256) = 16
--   Level 2 internal = ceil(16 / 256) = 1 (root)
--   Height = 3 levels => 3 disk reads for any lookup!

-- ===== INDEX MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS =====

-- Check index statistics
SHOW INDEX FROM Employees;

-- Analyze table to update index statistics
ANALYZE TABLE Employees;

-- Rebuild indexes (useful after many deletes)
ALTER TABLE Employees ENGINE=InnoDB;  -- MySQL: rebuild all indexes

-- Drop unused indexes (they slow down writes)
DROP INDEX idx_salary ON Employees;

-- ===== PARTIAL INDEX (PostgreSQL only) =====
-- CREATE INDEX idx_active ON Employees(name) WHERE status = 'active';
-- Only indexes active employees; smaller and faster

-- ===== EXPRESSION INDEX (PostgreSQL) =====
-- CREATE INDEX idx_lower_email ON Employees(LOWER(email));
-- Useful for case-insensitive searches`,

Key columns include <code>type</code> (access method: ALL, index, range, ref, eq_ref, const), <code>key</code> (index used), <code>rows</code> (estimated rows scanned), and <code>Extra</code> (e.g., Using index, Using filesort). Use it to identify full table scans, missing indexes, and unnecessary sorts.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: How do you optimize a slow query step by step?</b><br>A: (1) Run EXPLAIN to see the current plan. (2) Look for ALL access type or large row counts. (3) Add indexes on WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY columns. (4) Check for functions on indexed columns that prevent index usage. (5) Rewrite subqueries as JOINs where beneficial. (6) Use covering indexes to avoid table lookups. (7) Consider keyset pagination instead of large OFFSET values.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: Why is selection pushdown the most impactful optimization?</b><br>A: Selection pushdown applies WHERE filters as early as possible in the query plan, dramatically reducing the number of rows that flow through subsequent operations like joins and sorts. Filtering a million-row table down to 100 rows before a join is far cheaper than joining all million rows and filtering afterward.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Compare hash join, sort-merge join, and nested loop join.</b><br>A: Nested loop join (<span class="learn-complexity">O(m*n)</span>) iterates over each row of the outer table and scans the inner table &mdash; best when the inner table is small or has an index. Sort-merge join (<span class="learn-complexity">O(m log m + n log n)</span>) sorts both tables then merges &mdash; best when data is already sorted or both tables are large. Hash join (<span class="learn-complexity">O(m+n)</span>) builds a hash table on the smaller relation &mdash; best for equi-joins with no index and sufficient memory.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Why does applying a function on an indexed column prevent index usage?</b><br>A: The B+ Tree index stores original column values in sorted order. When you apply a function (e.g., <code>WHERE YEAR(date_col) = 2024</code>), the DBMS cannot navigate the tree because it would need to compute the function on every stored value. Instead, rewrite as a range condition: <code>WHERE date_col &gt;= \'2024-01-01\' AND date_col &lt; \'2025-01-01\'</code>.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What is keyset pagination and why is it better than OFFSET?</b><br>A: OFFSET-based pagination (<code>LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100000</code>) forces the database to scan and discard 100,000 rows before returning results. Keyset pagination uses the last seen value as a starting point (<code>WHERE id &gt; 100000 ORDER BY id LIMIT 10</code>), directly seeking to the correct position via the index. This provides consistent O(log n) performance regardless of how deep into the result set you paginate.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q7: When should you use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries?</b><br>A: EXISTS is generally more efficient for correlated subqueries because it short-circuits &mdash; it stops as soon as a matching row is found. IN materializes the full result of the subquery first. However, modern optimizers often transform between the two. EXISTS is preferred when the subquery could return many rows and you only need to know if at least one match exists.</p></div>',
          code: `-- =============================================
-- Query Processing & Optimization
-- =============================================

-- ===== EXPLAIN: Analyzing Query Plans =====

-- Full table scan (no index on dept)
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept = 'Engineering';
-- type: ALL, key: NULL => needs index

-- After adding index:
CREATE INDEX idx_dept ON Employees(dept);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept = 'Engineering';
-- type: ref, key: idx_dept => uses index

-- Range scan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 80000 AND 100000;
-- type: range (if index on salary exists)

-- Index-only scan (covering index)
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_sal_name ON Employees(dept, salary, name);
EXPLAIN SELECT name, salary FROM Employees WHERE dept = 'Engineering';
-- Extra: Using index (no table lookup needed)

-- ===== OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES =====

-- BAD: Function on indexed column prevents index usage
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 2024;
-- GOOD: Range condition uses index
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2024-01-01' AND hire_date < '2025-01-01';

-- BAD: SELECT * fetches unnecessary columns
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10;
-- GOOD: Select only needed columns (may use covering index)
SELECT name, salary FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10;

-- BAD: OR on different columns (may not use index)
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10 OR salary > 100000;
-- GOOD: Rewrite as UNION
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10
UNION
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 100000;

-- BAD: Leading wildcard prevents index usage
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE name LIKE '%alice%';
-- GOOD: No leading wildcard
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE name LIKE 'Alice%';

-- BAD: Implicit type conversion
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE emp_id = '42';  -- emp_id is INT
-- GOOD: Match types
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE emp_id = 42;

-- ===== JOIN ORDER OPTIMIZATION =====

-- The optimizer chooses join order, but you can hint:
-- MySQL: STRAIGHT_JOIN forces left-to-right order
SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN e.name, d.dept_name
FROM Employees e
STRAIGHT_JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- ===== SUBQUERY vs JOIN performance =====

-- Subquery (may be slower — executed per row):
SELECT name FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT dept_id FROM Departments WHERE location = 'NYC');

-- Equivalent JOIN (often faster):
SELECT e.name FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.location = 'NYC';

-- ===== PAGINATION OPTIMIZATION =====

-- BAD: Large OFFSET scans and discards rows
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY emp_id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100000;

-- GOOD: Keyset pagination (seek method)
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id > 100000
ORDER BY emp_id LIMIT 10;

-- ===== ANALYZING INDEX USAGE =====

-- Show all indexes on a table
SHOW INDEX FROM Employees;

-- Find unused indexes (MySQL performance_schema)
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE object_schema = 'mydb' AND index_name IS NOT NULL

This guarantees that even if the system crashes mid-write, the log contains enough information to either redo committed changes or undo uncommitted ones. Without WAL, a crash could leave the database in an inconsistent state with no way to determine what was or was not written.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Describe the three phases of ARIES and the purpose of each.</b><br>A: <b>Analysis</b> scans forward from the last checkpoint to build the dirty page table and identify which transactions were active at crash time (the loser set). <b>Redo</b> replays ALL logged operations (committed and uncommitted) from the earliest LSN in the dirty page table to restore the database to its exact pre-crash state &mdash; this is the "repeat history" principle. <b>Undo</b> scans backward and reverses all operations of uncommitted transactions, writing CLRs for each undone action.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: What are CLRs and why are they redo-only?</b><br>A: Compensation Log Records are written during the undo phase to record that a particular undo action was performed. They are redo-only (never undone themselves) because if the system crashes during recovery, the already-undone operations should not be undone again. Each CLR contains an UndoNextLSN pointer that tells recovery which log record to undo next, allowing it to skip already-compensated records.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: Explain the Steal/No-Force buffer management policy and why most systems use it.</b><br>A: <b>Steal</b> allows dirty (uncommitted) pages to be flushed to disk before commit, which frees buffer pool space. <b>No-Force</b> means committed changes are NOT required to be immediately flushed to disk at commit time, reducing I/O. This combination (Steal + No-Force) gives the best performance but requires both UNDO capability (for stolen uncommitted pages) and REDO capability (for committed but unflushed pages) &mdash; which is exactly what ARIES provides.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: What is the difference between a fuzzy and a sharp checkpoint?</b><br>A: A <b>sharp checkpoint</b> halts all transactions, flushes every dirty page to disk, then resumes &mdash; simple but causes a pause in processing. A <b>fuzzy checkpoint</b> (used by ARIES and most production databases) merely records the dirty page table and active transaction list without flushing all pages. It does not block operations, but recovery must start scanning from an earlier point in the log.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: How does point-in-time recovery work?</b><br>A: First, restore the most recent full (or incremental) backup to get the database to a known state. Then replay the WAL / binary log records forward in time up to the desired target timestamp or LSN. This allows recovering to any moment, for example just before an accidental <code>DROP TABLE</code>, by stopping the log replay right before that statement.</p></div>',

-- Recovery & Write-Ahead Logging (ARIES)
-- =============================================

-- ===== WAL CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION =====

-- InnoDB uses WAL: ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1 (redo logs)

-- Check redo log configuration
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_log_file_size';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_log_files_in_group';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit';
-- 1 = flush log to disk at every commit (safest, default)
-- 2 = write to OS buffer at commit, flush every second
-- 0 = write and flush every second (fastest, least safe)

-- ===== TRANSACTION LOG EXAMPLE =====

-- Scenario: T1 transfers money, T2 updates salary, crash happens

-- T1: Transfer $500 from Account 1 to Account 2
START TRANSACTION;  -- Log: [BEGIN T1]
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE acc_id = 1;
-- Log: [T1, UPDATE, Accounts.acc_id=1, old=10000, new=9500]
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE acc_id = 2;
-- Log: [T1, UPDATE, Accounts.acc_id=2, old=5000, new=5500]
COMMIT;  -- Log: [COMMIT T1]

-- T2: Update salary (not yet committed when crash happens)
START TRANSACTION;  -- Log: [BEGIN T2]
UPDATE Employees SET salary = 120000 WHERE emp_id = 1;
-- Log: [T2, UPDATE, Employees.emp_id=1, old=100000, new=120000]
-- *** CRASH BEFORE COMMIT ***

-- ARIES Recovery:
-- 1. ANALYSIS: Read from checkpoint.
--    T1 committed (in redo set), T2 active (in undo/loser set).
-- 2. REDO: Replay ALL log records from dirty page table's min LSN.
--    Redo T1's updates (ensure they're on disk).
--    Redo T2's update too (repeat history).
-- 3. UNDO: Undo T2's changes (not committed).
--    Write CLR: [CLR, T2, Employees.emp_id=1, undo to 100000]
--    Log: [ABORT T2]
-- Database is now consistent: T1's changes preserved, T2 rolled back.

-- ===== CHECKPOINT =====

-- InnoDB performs fuzzy checkpointing automatically
-- Force a checkpoint (for understanding):
-- FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;  -- Sharp checkpoint (blocks writes)
-- UNLOCK TABLES;

-- Check checkpoint info
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;  -- Look for "Log sequence number" and "Last checkpoint at"

-- ===== BACKUP AND RECOVERY =====

-- Logical backup
-- mysqldump --single-transaction --routines --triggers mydb > backup.sql

-- Physical backup (using Percona XtraBackup or MySQL Enterprise Backup)
-- xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/backup/full/

-- Point-in-time recovery using binary logs:
-- 1. Restore full backup
-- 2. Apply binary logs:
-- mysqlbinlog --start-position=154 --stop-datetime="2024-06-15 14:30:00" \\
--     /var/lib/mysql/binlog.000042 | mysql -u root

-- ===== UNDO LOG SEGMENTS =====
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_undo_tablespaces';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_undo_log_truncate';

-- Check undo log usage
SELECT * FROM information_schema.INNODB_TRX;  -- Active transactions
-- Long-running transactions hold undo log segments,
-- preventing purge of old versions (affects MVCC)`,

Since network partitions are inevitable, the practical choice is CP or AP. <b>CP example:</b> HBase and ZooKeeper refuse requests during a partition to ensure all reads return the latest write. <b>AP example:</b> Cassandra and DynamoDB continue serving reads and writes during a partition, accepting that some nodes may return stale data until the partition heals and replicas converge.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: Why is a CA system impractical in distributed systems?</b><br>A: A CA system would guarantee both consistency and availability but cannot tolerate network partitions. In a distributed environment, network partitions are a reality &mdash; switches fail, cables get cut, cloud availability zones lose connectivity. A system that ignores partitions is effectively a single-node system (like a traditional RDBMS), which is not truly distributed.

In system design interviews, you will be expected to justify your database choice based on access patterns, consistency requirements, and scale.</p></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Why NoSQL?</div><p class="learn-p">NoSQL databases emerged to handle: <b>massive scale</b> (petabytes), <b>flexible schemas</b> (schema-on-read), <b>high write throughput</b>, and <b>horizontal scaling</b>.

Modern systems often use <b>polyglot persistence</b> — SQL for transactional data, Redis for caching, MongoDB for content, Elasticsearch for search.</div></div><div class="learn-section"><div class="learn-h">Interview Spotlight</div><p class="learn-p"><b>Q1: When would you choose MongoDB over PostgreSQL?</b><br>A: MongoDB excels when your data has a <b>variable or evolving schema</b> (e.g., product catalogs where each category has different attributes), when you need to store <b>deeply nested documents</b> that would require many JOINs in an RDBMS, and when your read patterns align with document boundaries. PostgreSQL is better when you need complex multi-table JOINs, full ACID transactions across multiple entities, or advanced SQL features like window functions and CTEs.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q2: What are the main Redis data structures and their use cases?</b><br>A: <b>Strings</b> for caching and counters (SET/GET/INCR). <b>Hashes</b> for object storage (HSET/HGET &mdash; like a mini document). <b>Lists</b> for message queues (LPUSH/RPOP). <b>Sets</b> for tags, unique visitors, intersections (SADD/SMEMBERS/SINTER). <b>Sorted Sets</b> for leaderboards and priority queues (ZADD/ZRANGE). <b>Streams</b> for event sourcing and log processing. Redis also supports pub/sub, Lua scripting, and transactions via MULTI/EXEC.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q3: How does Cassandra partition key design affect query performance?</b><br>A: The partition key determines which node stores the data via consistent hashing. All rows with the same partition key are stored together on the same node, making queries within a partition extremely fast (sequential disk reads). A poorly chosen partition key can create <b>hot spots</b> (all data on one node) or require expensive <b>scatter-gather queries</b> across all nodes. The rule of thumb: design your partition key so that each query hits exactly one partition.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q4: What advantage do graph databases have over RDBMS for relationship-heavy queries?</b><br>A: In an RDBMS, traversing relationships requires JOINs, and the cost grows with the size of the tables being joined. In a graph database like Neo4j, relationships are stored as direct pointers between nodes, making each traversal hop <b>O(1)</b> regardless of the total dataset size. A "friends of friends of friends" query that would require 3 self-JOINs in SQL (potentially scanning millions of rows) is a simple 3-hop traversal in a graph DB.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q5: Explain embedding vs referencing in MongoDB document design.</b><br>A: <b>Embed</b> when: the relationship is 1:1 or 1:few, the sub-data is always read with the parent, and you need atomic updates on the whole document. <b>Reference</b> (store an ID and look up separately) when: the relationship is 1:many with unbounded growth (e.g., comments on a post), the related data is updated independently, or you have many-to-many relationships. Embedding gives faster reads (single query) but can cause document bloat; referencing requires multiple queries but keeps documents lean.</p><p class="learn-p"><b>Q6: What does BASE mean and how does it contrast with ACID?</b><br>A: BASE stands for <b>Basically Available</b> (the system guarantees some level of availability even during failures), <b>Soft state</b> (the system state may change over time even without new input, due to eventual consistency), and <b>Eventually consistent</b> (given enough time without new writes, all replicas will converge). ACID prioritizes correctness and strong consistency; BASE prioritizes availability and partition tolerance, accepting temporary inconsistency as a trade-off.</p></div>',
          code: `// === NoSQL Database Comparison & Usage Patterns ===

// ===== 1. KEY-VALUE: Redis (using pseudo C++ client) =====
// Best for: caching, session store, rate limiting, leaderboards
/*
  redis_client.SET("session:abc123", "{user_id: 1001}", "EX", 3600);
  string session = redis_client.GET("session:abc123");

  // Rate limiting with sliding window

  redis_client.EXPIRE("api:user1001:minute", 60);
  int count = redis_client.GET("api:user1001:minute");
  if (count > 100) reject_request();
*/

// ===== 2. DOCUMENT: MongoDB operations =====
// Best for: user profiles, content, catalogs, event logging

// Insert
// db.users.insertOne({
//   name: "Alice", age: 30,
//   address: { city: "NYC" },
//   tags: ["premium", "active"]
// })

// Query with filters
// db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 25 }, "address.city": "NYC" })

// Aggregation pipeline
// db.orders.aggregate([
//   { $match: { status: "completed" } },
//   { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
//   { $sort: { total: -1 } },
//   { $limit: 10 }
// ])

// ===== 3. COLUMN-FAMILY: Cassandra CQL =====
// Best for: time-series, IoT, write-heavy, multi-datacenter

// CREATE TABLE user_activity (
//   user_id UUID,
//   activity_date DATE,
//   activity_time TIMESTAMP,
//   action TEXT,
//   PRIMARY KEY ((user_id, activity_date), activity_time)
// ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (activity_time DESC);
//
// -- Partition key: (user_id, activity_date) → one partition per user per day
// -- Query: "all activities for user X on date Y" is a single partition read

// ===== 4. GRAPH: Neo4j Cypher =====
// Best for: social networks, recommendations, fraud detection

// Shortest path between two people:
// MATCH path = shortestPath(
//   (a:Person {name:"Alice"})-[:KNOWS*..6]-(b:Person {name:"Eve"})
// )
// RETURN path

// Recommendation: "People who bought X also bought Y"
// MATCH (u:User)-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product {name:"Laptop"})
//       -[:BOUGHT_WITH]->(rec:Product)
// WHERE NOT (u)-[:BOUGHT]->(rec)
// RETURN rec.name, COUNT(*) as score ORDER BY score DESC

// ===== DATA MODELING PATTERNS =====

// Embedding vs Referencing (MongoDB):
// EMBED when: 1:1 or 1:few, data read together, atomic updates needed
// REFERENCE when: 1:many (unbounded), data updated independently, many:many

// Denormalization (Cassandra):
// Model tables around your QUERIES, not your entities
// Duplicate data across tables to avoid JOINs
// One table per query pattern is the norm`,
